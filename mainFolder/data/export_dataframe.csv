1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, This is Michael Bluth.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, For ten years he's worked for his father's company waiting to be made a partner. And right now he's happy. This is Michael's mother.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille," Look what they've done, Michael!"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, She isn't happy.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille, Look what the homosexuals have done to me!
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael,You can't just comb that out and reset it? 
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, Currently she's upset that her husband's retirement party is being upstaged by a group of gay protesters.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Protesters," (Chanting) We're here, we're queer! We want to get married on the ocean!"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille, Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire!
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay,"Good grief, Mother! Not all homosexuals are flamboy... Oh, my God, I have the exact same blouse. "
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," This is Michael's twin sister, Lindsay."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille, I like it better on him.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," As a youthful act of defiance, Lindsay married this man."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, They moved to Boston where they've become celebrated for their wine and cheese fund-raisers.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay," Oh, no. I'm completely stuffed. Um, I forget their name but I know they're hungry. I think some of them are thirsty."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, Michael and his sister haven't spoken in a year. Neither has acknowledged this.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," So, this is the magic trick, huh?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B.," ""Illusion,"" Michael. A ""trick"" is something a whore does for money..."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B., Or cocaine! 
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," G.O.B. recently started the Alliance of Magicians, an organization that blackballs any performer who reveals a magician's secret."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," And finally, there's Buster, the youngest of Michael's siblings."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Hey, Buster."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," You know, you don't need to do that, buddy. It's okay."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," Thanks to the family's largesse, Buster has studied everything from Native American tribal ceremonies..."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, the mapping of uncharted territories.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Buster, the mapping of uncharted territories.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Sure. Hasn't everything already sort of been discovered, though by, like, Magellan and Cortés? NASA, you know?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Buster," Oh, yeah, yeah."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, ...all those people.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Buster, Those guys did a pretty good job.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Right.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Buster, But there's still. You know...
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille, Never hurts to double-check.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, He also suffers from crippling panic attacks.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," Yes, this is his family. So, why is Michael so happy? Because he's decided to never speak to these people again."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, Michael was feeling more generous about his family on the morning of the boat party.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, What comes before anything? What have we always said is the most important thing?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, Breakfast.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Family.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael,"Family, right. I thought you meant of the things you eat. "
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," This is Michael's son, George Michael."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," I mean, we've made nothing but sacrifices for this family, and tonight, it all pays off, my boy. Tonight, your granddad makes me partner."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," To prove his dedication to the family business, Michael has decided to live here..."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, ...in the model unit of his father's latest housing tract. The guys live in the attic so that the house can still function as a pristine selling tool.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, So you thin he's gonna announce it on the boat?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Yeah, absolutely. It's his retirement party. Plus, he's been dropping a lot of hints."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, What kind of hints?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," It's funny. It's not a ""hint"" hint, but he has been calling me ""pardner."""
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael," Yeah, that's... that's like partner."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Of course, he has been going through a little bit of a cowboy phase. No. I'll be my own boss. I'll finally be able to get you what you deserve. Like a real home."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, This is a real home.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," No, it's not. It's a fake home, son. You want the loops or the flakes today?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, I'd rather live like this than like my aunt and uncles whose eyes have never stung from the sweet sweat of a hard day's work.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you gettin' all that?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, From you. You say it every couple of years when they come out to visit.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Well, maybe you're right. Maybe they are spoiled. But you know what, son? That is not our problem. That is their problem. We have a good thing going here, you see? You'll find that you have much more dignity and self-respect when you learn..."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, that this house has got everything we're looking for.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael," And more! Can we buy it, Dad? Can we buy the house?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," We're gonna try, son. But we gotta hurry. These are gonna get all snapped up. Oh, good morning. I'll race you to the bank."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, All right.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," The guys then headed down to Balboa Island. It was here, in 1953, that George Sr. started a business selling a novelty food item called the frozen banana."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," Like his father before him, Michael had gotten his son a job there to bolster the boy's self-esteem."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, Ten cents gets you nuts. Uncle G.O.B.? Uncle G.O.B.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B.," Give me a dollar. No, the twenty. This is gonna blow your mind. Some say wealth is an illusion. Well, let's just see. For one moment it's here, and in the next..."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B., Monopoly.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B.,"You don't have it, do you?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael," Yeah, I think I might."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B.," That's good, 'cause a lot of the pieces are missing. Oh, to play Monopoly with my family again. I'd give anything to be eight."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, I'm 13.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B.," No, I wasn't crazy about 13. The acne, self-consciousness, the erections. You okay?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael," Yeah, I'm okay."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B.," Hey, there's the man I came to see."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael," Uh, Uncle G.O.B., where's the twenty?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B.," Hey, a magician never reveals his secret. That's what I started the whole alliance about."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, I don't need the secret. I just need the twenty.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B., What you need to know... is that it's magic.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, Wow... It's so much like stealing.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," Michael, meanwhile, was meeting his brother G.O.B., hoping to discuss his father's boat party."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," It's sort of a ""pass the torch"" kind of, situation, so if you've got a wireless mic..."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Boat Captain, Got it.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Or a torch. Now that I think about it. It's just a joke.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Hey.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B., Michael.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, G.O.B.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," I'm sorry. Uh, Captain, this is my brother, G.O.B."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Boat Captain, How are you?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B., Incredible! I'm having an incredible year. Right on top.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, We'll finish inside. Look at you. Are you doing good?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B.," Please, look."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Right. Great.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, You got your check for your share of the party?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B.," You know, I sort of thought my contribution could be a magic show."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," A magic show?! Oh, that's perfect, G.O.B."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B., Thank you.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Or, wait a minute. I just remembered something. Dad's retiring, not turning six. "
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B.," Hey, come on, I just bought this new illusion called The Aztec Tomb. It cost, like, eighteen grand."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Come on, G.O.B. I don't care."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B.," I'm gonna do it on the boat. Look, what do you care? Can't you just charge the party to the company?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," No, it's not a business expense."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B.," So what? Lindsay's been staying at the Four Seas for, like, a month. She's probably charging the company."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Lindsay's been in town for a month?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B., I don't think so.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," Michael was upset to hear this, so he went to discuss it with his mother."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Mom? Mother? Give me your company checkbook. You're cut off.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille," Michael, look. Look what happened to my fox. Someone cut off his little foot. Is it... is it noticeable?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Well... you've got to remember, you're going to be all splattered in red paint. That's gonna distract the eye. I don't want you charging any more of your personal expenses to the company."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille," Well, I had to pay for The Aztec Tomb. G.O.B. says it's a career-maker."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Wait a minute-the company paid for The Aztec Tomb? That's great. Well, I was talking about Lindsay, okay? You put her in a five-star hotel, on top of which, you didn't even tell me that she was in town."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille," If you're saying I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all my children equally."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille, I don't care for G.O.B. 
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Buster, (gulp)
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille," Good grief, I dipped into the kitty a couple of times. You should be focused on tonight. Dad's making a big announcement."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Yeah? I knew it. It's about me, isn't it?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille, (winks)
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, I wonder how I can talk you out of ever making that face again
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias, Michael!
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Tobias.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias, How are you?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Uh-huh. (Chuckling) Good, good. How's your, uh, job search coming?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias, It's good.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Yeah?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias, It's going to be good. It's going to be good.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias, I'm hoping the universe provides a path for me.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," Tobias recently lost his medical license for administering C.P.R. to a person who, as it turned out, was not having a heart attack."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Maybe you'll be inspired by the boat party tonight and start a career as a pirate.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias, I haven't packed for that. 
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, Couldn't find a thing.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Lindsay.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, Michael!
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, How was your flight?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, Great! Great! We just got in.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille, He knows.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay," A month ago. Oh, I'm sorry, I've been meaning to call you, I really have."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Really?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay," It's just... I've been... Well, I need to decompress. I've been very busy."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias, It's been crazy.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, We just had an amazing fund-raiser for H.O.O.P.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, H.O.O.P.?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, My anti-circumcision movement.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, I think it looks frightening when it's cut off. It's a Doberman. Let it have its ears.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Hmmm.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay," Believe it or not, we brought in over $40,000."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Unbelievable. Sounds like you saved enough skin to make ten new boys. 
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias," Well, most of that money was from..."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias," ...the Bluth Company. I mean, how... are you?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Still good. You know what? You guys have had your hands in the company coffer for years, but starting tomorrow, there is going to be a new boss in town,"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, and you're all going to have to start fending for yourselves.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, You're all going to finally feel that sweet sting of sweat in your eyes as...
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Buster, you can't do that on the balcony, buddy?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Buster, (stops playing the drum)
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Buster, Mom says it's too windy.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille, Who could've done this?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," While Michael was getting fed up with his family, George Michael was finally getting to know them."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby," Um, yeah, I bought a frozen banana, and when I bit into it, I found this."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, It looks like a foot.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby," It tasted like a foot. Which I didn't really mind, but I'm pretty sure I said ""no nuts."""
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael," Hey, you're my cousin, aren't you?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby, Maeby.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, This is George Michael's cousin Maeby.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, Maeby had always found unique ways to rebel.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay," Maeby, this is a cute tattoo for you."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby, I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, We never see you. We never see anybody in our family.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby," I know, it's our parents' faults. We should teach them a lesson."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael," (Laughing) Yeah... yeah... No, I-I don't think so."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby," I should go to my mom tonight and be, like, ""I met the cutest guy,"" and then she'll see you and me totally making out."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael," (Laughing) Yeah. (Continues laughing) But not really, right?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby," It's perfect! She'd freak out, and I'd be, like, ""Mom, if we saw each other more often, this wouldn't happen."""
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, But we're cousins.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby, That's what makes it funny.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, But isn't it against the law?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby, I don't think so.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, I know for certain that the yacht club would have a problem with it.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby," Come on, George Michael."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," Tobias, now believing the boat party to be pirate-themed..."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias," Well, you look like a pirate!"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, ...began searching through his wife's luggage for an outfit.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias," I should say so. Look at the blouse, sir."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator,"Then, mistaking a group of garishly dressed men for pirates, Tobias boarded a van full of homosexuals. Soon, he was unwittingly part of a protest against the local yacht club."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias, How are you?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay," Oh, my God, I have the exact same blouse."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille, I like it better on him.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby," I don't understand why you work every weekend. Aren't you, like, my age?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael," Well, it's important to be responsible. I think there aren't enough young people out there today who have a real work ethic."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby, What do you mean?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, I don't know.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, And George Sr. finally made his retirement speech.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,"George, Sr."," I guess it's time for me to, uh, mosey on. And although I won't be saddling up and going in every day..."

1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, I guess we're going to see you guys even less now.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby, I told you we should have taught them a lesson.

1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, The Bluth family dominated the news that night.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,John Beard," Southern California is the home of the high-speed freeway chase but tonight's flee from justice was on the sea and slow as molasses. Bluth Development Company president George Bluth was arrested tonight for defrauding investors, and using the company as his personal piggy bank. More intrigue on the high seas tonight, as dozens of local pirates were arrested for protesting the Yacht Club's discriminatory policies."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, Even Michael's brother G.O.B. made the news.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Trisha Thoon," It was Mr. Bluth's son ""Gawb,"" a part-time magician, who hid his father here, in The Aztec Tomb. By pushing on this pivoting panel Mr. Bluth was able to hide in this airless chamber"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B., I have to think the Alliance is going to frown on this.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Trisha Thoon," Perhaps a good trick for a human, but the dogs found him almost instantly."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Man in Police station," Free at last, y'all."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias," I'm all right, gang. I'm all right."

1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias," Oh, what an adventure. Oh, my goodness. Buster... don't do that. What an adventure, gang. I thought that the homosexuals were pirates. But it turns out that most of them were actors in the local theater. You're right though, it is amazing. I've been waiting for the universe to provide a path for me and... and I think it has."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, You're gay.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias,"No. No. No, I'm not... I'm not gay. No. Lindsay, how many times must we have this... No. I want to be an actor. "
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Okay, guys, um... they are going to keep Dad in prison at least until this gets all sorted out. Also, the attorney said that they're going to have to put a halt on the company's expense account."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Interesting. I would've expected that after ""They're keeping Dad in jail."" The first thing I need you guys to do is to cut up your company credit cards."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Buster, What about the miles?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay," You know, Michael, Dad did name Mom as his successor."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille, And I'm putting Buster in charge.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B., He's a good choice.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Buster? The guy who thought that the blue on the map was land?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille, He's had business classes.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Buster,"Wa-Wa-Wa-Wait. 18th-century agrarian business, but I guess it's all the same principles. Let me ask you, are you at all concerned about an uprising? "
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," You wanna know what? That's it. I'm done. I'm sick and tired of the greed and the selfishness and all the taking. Forget it. I've got a son to think about. And you know, Lindsay, by the way, I expected this from them because they're completely oblivious, but you... you should know better."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B., Think he's really mad at you.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," In the days that followed, the Bluths' assets were officially frozen."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, There's no more room in the suitcase.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias, Glasses. Where are my glasses?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, On your face
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, Lindsay had no choice but to check her family out of the hotel earlier than planned.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias, What are we doing with this? What is happening with this?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, And her husband started looking for work.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias," My name is Dr. Tobias Fünke. I was chief resident of psychiatry at Mass General for two years, and I did my fellowship in psycholinguistics at MIT."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias," And this is ""I'm A Bad Bad Man"" from Annie Get Your Gun."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias, (Hesitating) I... I... I... I'm...
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, Lucille was finding it difficult to go about her daily life.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille," The SEC is making him out to be some kind of mastermind, which believe me, he's not. The man could barely work our shredder."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, Michael was able to secure a job with a rival housing company almost immediately.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Enrique," Plus, there are perks. We'll set you up in Arizona in one of our finest estates."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Attic or main house?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, And Buster was discovering his academic pursuits didn't fully prepare him for his new responsibilities.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Executive," Have you looked at the latest figures on the Sudden Valley expansion, vis-a-vis the development versus the tax that it..."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Buster, Amazing. You guys are so smart.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Executive," ...two percent per annum, but this is a non-recoupable..."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille, We need Michael.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B., We need ice.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Buster, Michael... We need Michael.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias, Perhaps... an intervention.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B., So what we'd like to do here is just go around the room... and have everyone talk a little about Michael. Things we don't like about him or how he annoys us... or maybe just something he does that rubs us the wrong way.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille, Jump right in.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias, There's no right or wrong answer.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille, I think that's a great idea.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Wait. Hold on one second. What exactly is this intervention for?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille, We need you to come back and run the business.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Oh, okay. Well, then, so, technically it's not really an intervention. It's a little bit more of an imposition, if you think about it."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay," Oh, whatever you want to call it."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael,I'd love to call it an imposition. 
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B.," We're in trouble here, Michael. And I can't perform my magic. I'm getting blackballed from even the smaller venues."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Birthday Party Man," Well, it's come down to the two of you. I'll be honest. I'm just more comfortable with an Alliance-approved magician."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B.," Aw. Give 'em a hell of a show, champ."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Teen Magician," Fuck off, traitor."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, I thought Buster had everything under control. I thought you'd been going to the office.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Buster," Yes, and I've enjoyed that. It was just I was constantly being called to the phone or I was asked a question or I was resuscitated. It was really hard to get a good work flow going."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby, Can you believe this? They're still fighting.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael," Yeah, I know. I'm tempted to kiss again so we could teach 'em a lesson."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby, Why would that teach them a lesson?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael," No, I mean, uh, to freak them out."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby, That doesn't make any sense.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, Isn't that what makes it funny? I'm laughing. Go fish' u know Okay. I just need a drink.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Well, I'm sorry. It's just too late. I'm moving to Phoenix. I got a job. Something you apply for, and then they pay you to, uh... never mind. I don't want to ruin the surprise."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," So no hard feelings? Adios, Sayonara. I'll see you when the first parent dies."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lucille," Well, I'd rather be dead in California than alive in Arizona."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Tobias, Touché. Touché.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B., Too good.

1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay," Well, the least you could do is say good-bye to him."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," In fact, Michael had not spoken to his father since the arrest, and he decided to give his father the courtesy of a formal resignation."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, I quit.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,"George, Sr.", Probably a good career move. 
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," You know, I parked in the same spot for the last five years. I was there on time every single day."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,"George, Sr.", Mike...
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," I was so loyal, I worked so hard. Why didn't you just put me in charge?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,"George, Sr."," Michael, listen to me. These guys, the SEC, they've been after me for years. I put you in charge, you're going to be wearing one of these orange jumpsuits, too."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, I could've helped you if you'd told me.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,"George, Sr."," You'd be an accomplice. No, it had to be your mom. They cannot arrest a husband and wife for the same crime."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Yeah? I don't think that that's true, Dad."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,"George, Sr.", Really? I've got the worst fucking attorneys! 
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, What are you saying? That you did this for me?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,"George, Sr.", What have we always said comes before anything else?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,"George, Sr.", It's family first.

1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, Okay. (hugs Lindsay very long)
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Sorry. Well, I guess he really misses his family."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay," Well, he doesn't know us very well."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Yeah, clearly. Let me ask you a question. Where the hell have you been? Why didn't you call me?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay," Look at my life, Michael. Tobias is out of work, we're in debt. It's..."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, What are you doing? Are you trying to cry?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, I'm sad. Life is hard right now. I've got the J.D.L. on my ass.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, J.D.L.?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, Jewish Defense League.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Oh, the circumcision thing? This is why I was against H.O.O.P. Why don't you just mind your own business, Lindsay?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay," See? This is why I didn't call you, Michael, because you're so judgmental."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," No, I'm not judgmental."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, And you're disappointed in me.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, I'm not disappointed in you.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, You are.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," So I'm disappointed in you, but, come on, what is not disappointing about my life? Dad didn't give me the promotion. Dad's in jail. How disappointing is that?"
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, So we're a disappointing family.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," We're an incredibly disappointing family. But we are a family... and I want my son to be happy, so... maybe we should be in each other's lives."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, I'd like that.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, Yeah?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Seriously, you're going to pull a muscle."

1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator," So Michael decided to stay in California and try to save the family business. And for the first time ever, he gathered his family together in the model home."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B.," Dad was always banker, so there was no beating him."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, Totally.

1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, these guys are actually going to be staying with us. For a while. Just your aunt. And her husband. Not G.O.B.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,George Michael, Really?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael," Yeah. What the hell, huh? Family first, right? It is going to be a little crowded though, so I think you're going to have to share a room with your cousin."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Music, What you tryin' to say to me?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, On the next Arrested Development. George Michael gets a new roommate.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Maeby, (Singing in shower) I did know what I do-o-o-n-e. I'm not that innocent.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, Many find work for the first time.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Sales woman, This is the most expensive watch we have so only let the customers who are truly serious try it on.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Lindsay, It is a fun watch. I'll take it.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Enrique," It was really your brother we were interested in. I mean, you don't even have any references."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,G.O.B., Is that enough of a reference for you?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Enrique," Even a letter of recommendation, something like that."
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Narrator, And Michael finds it difficult to get his father out of jail.
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,Michael, You love it here?
1,Pilot,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pilot,"George, Sr."," Oh, I'm having the time of my life. Hey, T-Bone."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,John Beard," Another setback for the once prominent Bluth family as their frozen banana stand, a Newport Beach landmark, burns to the ground. A delicious whodunit... after this."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator," A week before the fire, Michael Bluth was trying to save the Bluth Company, but his father was making it difficult."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," I need the flight records, Dad. I'm trying to find some money for the family."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, There's always money in the banana stand. 
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, I am having a love affair with this ice cream sandwich. 
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, You want some? Take a bite.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Please, please... The SEC has locked up our funds. These guys aren't messing around."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Guard, No touching! 
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," So, I need you to tell me. Were you taking vacations in the jet? Is that what you're hiding from me?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George," I haven't had a vacation in years. This is my vacation. I'm exercising, I'm sleeping well."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, You're doing time.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, I'm doing the time of my life. 
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,T-Bone," What's up, pumpkin?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, Hey! T-Bone. T-Bone's my roommate.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, (Sotto voce.) He's a flamer.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, T's checking out today.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,T-Bone, Yeah.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Well, guess every vacation's got to come to an end."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, Just made a fool of yourself in front of T-Bone. 
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George," Anyway, I want you to give him a job at the company. Sales."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, I'm not going to do that.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, Why not?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Well, because..."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, Because he's a flamer? Because I told you that in confidence.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," You don't seem to understand that I'm running this company now, Dad, and I need the flight records, and I'm going to get them with or without your help."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Guard, No touching!
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George," I got something we can try, all right? It's a little risky."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Please.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, Open up.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, What do you mean about...?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator," While George Sr. was losing a roommate, George Michael was having a hard time adjusting to his new one."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Maeby, Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael, I'm up!
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias," Okay, we are just about ass-to-ankles back here, Maeby. Do you want to hop on your cousin's lap there, please? "
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Whoa, bumpy road ahead."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Maeby, (Singing in shower.) Got nothing on the love now...
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator," So, he addressed his problem head-on."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael," Dad, I want to work more hours at the banana stand."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Wow. Well, that's great. You know, I used to be just like you when I was a kid. I used to love it there."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George," It's going to be our best summer ever, Mikey!"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Well, I'll tell you what. I'm going to give you a promotion. Welcome aboard, Mr. Manager."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael, Wow. I'm Mr. Manager.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Well, manager; we just say manager. "
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, And you can hire an employee if you need one.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael, Do you think I need one?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Don't look at me, Mr. Manager."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael," Right, it's up to me now. I'm Mr. Manager."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Manager. We-we just say, uh..."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael," I know, but you..."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Doesn't matter who.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, I don't know what I expected.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, What's going on? This is exactly where the two of you were when I left this morning. Is nobody going to even try to get a job?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay," I have a job, Michael. It's called supporting my husband."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, You certainly haven't been shopping. The only thing I found in the freezer was a dead dove in a bag.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,G.O.B.," You didn't eat that, did you? ‘Cause I've only got a couple days left to return it. It died right in the middle of a show."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Clerk, Do you want a cage for that?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,G.O.B.," No, I'm a magician."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,G.O.B.," What is your return policy, by the way?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay," Not that I have to defend myself, but for your information, I did go shopping."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, You spent $68 on hair conditioner?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay," Small price to pay for self-esteem, Michael. Or are you still jealous that you lost ""best hair"" to me in high school and got ""dorkiest""? "
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator, Lindsay's achievements in high school had always overshadowed Michael's.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias," I agree with Michael; it's important not to tie your self-esteem to how you look or what people think of you. I mean, look at me- I'm an actor. An actor, for crying out loud. You know how much rejection I face every day? But in this business of show, you have to have the heart of an angel and the hide... of an elephant."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay," But, you've never actually had an audition."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias, Well... excuse me! Excuse me.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Some really great spousal support.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," You know something, Lindsay, you might want to start thinking about the example you're setting for your daughter, unless you want her to end up just like you."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Maeby," Yeah, shoot me when that happens."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Is there a carbon monoxide leak in this house?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," George Michael, you're taking your cousin to work today. That's your new employee. I do not want my niece to end up just like everyone in this family."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay, You're not telling my daughter what to do. She's a child.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Maeby," No, I'm not. I can work."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael," Uh, I-I don't know about this. You know, it can get pretty hairy in there."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay," Fine. Do what you want. If I know my daughter, that stand won't be there in a week."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," You stay on top of her, buddy. Do not be afraid to ride her. Hard. "
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator, George Michael's attempt to distance himself from his cousin proved... unsuccessful.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael, I can't tell you how many health codes you're violating right now.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Maeby," I can't believe I volunteered for this. This is my stupidest rebellion ever. Hey, you want to go play skee-ball?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael," Well, this is the cash drawer. My dad's going to come by at the end of the weekend, and the number of bananas has to match the amount of money in here."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Maeby," Oh, so it all has to even out?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael, Exactly.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Maeby, Easy. Banana... Buck. Banana... Take a buck. 
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator, And Michael went to his mother for the flight records his father wouldn't give him.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille, Then why don't you marry an ice cream sandwich? I've got to go. 
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Who was that? Was that Dad?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille, That was G.O.B.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Uh-huh.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," So, Mom, I'm trying to find..."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille, I don't know where they are.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," ...these flight records. You know, it's really more believable if you let me finish."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Why am I the only one that seems to get how much trouble this family is in?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille," Oh, I get it, Michael, I get it. But how should I know where the records are kept? Your father's in charge of all that."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," No, I'm in charge of all of that, and I think that you do know where they are."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille," Oh, it's probably all in a storage unit somewhere."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Where's the storage unit?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille, I don't remember.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Try.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille," Something-dale. I don't know- Brookfeather, Raintree. It's hot. It was very hot there. I've never been... get a warrant."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Don't think I won't. Mother, Mother, I care about this family."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille," And I do too, my darling. That's why I'm worried about G.O.B..."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille, I was on the phone with him this morning.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," You mean just now, right? When I came in?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille," Yes, just now, when you came in."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille," And he's upset, he's very upset. You haven't included him in the business at all. He's your older brother. You could find a little job for him."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille, Make him feel special.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," But he's not special, Mother."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille, No. But he loves you. We all love you.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Where's the storage unit?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille, It's with your warrant.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille," Luz, that coat cost more than your house! Oh, that's how we joke. She doesn't even have a house. "
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator," The next day, Tobias looked for work."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias," Hmm- Actor Pull. Oh, look at all these parts!"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Tobias. Nice to see you off the couch.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias," I was looking for work, and... I blew it, Michael."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Yeah, I guess you've already seen that."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias," Yes, I have, but... Oh, right, this one. Yeah, I... I'll call them again, I guess. I give them... one more shot."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator, And that's when Michael figured out how to get his mother to lead him to the storage unit where the flight records were kept.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille, Hello?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Yeah, hey, Mom, it's Michael. Listen, before I forget, I talked to the IRS, and they want to come by your apartment today to see if you charged any big ticket stuff to the company. Furs, or... I don't know. Just a heads up. Oh, that poor woman."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator," So, Michael followed Luz who had been sent to hide the evidence. Meanwhile, Tobias had arranged an audition for a local commercial. Lindsay came along to appear supportive."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias, This could take awhile.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay," Honey, it's one line."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias, Not if I do my job right.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias," First of all, I love it. Quick question, though. Am I panicked about the fire, or am I being brave for everyone else?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Roger Danish," The fire? It's, it's a fire sale. "
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias," (Chuckling.) Oh... Okay. I didn't, um... Well, let's give it a shot."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias," Oh, my God, we're having a fire. Sale. Oh, the burning! It burns me! Evacuate all the schoolchildren! (Screaming. Singing ""Amazing Grace."") This isn't a fever! (Continues singing.) Can't even see where the knob is! (Dramatic sigh.) And scene. "
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Roger Danish, Um... would you like to try that a little simpler... maybe?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias, No.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Roger Danish," Okay, anybody else? Anyone? Lindsay Bluth?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias, It's Fünke.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay, Roger Danish.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Roger Danish, Look at you. I can't believe it's Lindsay Bluth.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay, Oh...!
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias, Fünke.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay, Roger was my male counterpart in high school. Remember how crazy our hair was back then?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Roger Danish, What were we thinking?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay," So, what are you doing now?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias," He's, uh, casting my commercial."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Roger Danish," Yeah, trying to. The South Coast Boutique is having a fire sale."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay, South Coast Boutique? They're having a fire sale?!
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator," Meanwhile, Michael was still following his mother's housekeeper. And she did finally lead him to the storage unit. Unfortunately, it was on fire."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Yeah? What do you mean, arson?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay," It shoots tomorrow, and are you ready for this? It pays 1,000 bucks!"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, I thought that was Tobias' part.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias," Yeah, no, no, I did not book this one. I, uh... think I made the fire too real, uh, for them, and, uh, and probably failed to highlight the sale, so, good for her, and, uh... will you excuse me, please? "
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Well, listen, that's great, Lindsay. But, I've got my own problems. The flight records, they've burned up, okay? That's fine. That's over with. But I think Dad is behind it. I think Dad is trying to run the business from prison."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay," Well, isn't that ironic? I'm making a fortune at my new job, and you don't even have the job you thought you did."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," But, but you don't have a job. You've got a job offer. Anybody can get a job offer."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," So, I'm going to go see Dad, because this is my business to run now."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,G.O.B., Your business?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Hey, there you are, G.O.B.! I have been looking all over for you. I could really use some help."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,G.O.B.," Well, I was going to return this dove. What? You want me to run a meeting for you or something?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Or, even better, could you mail this letter for me?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,G.O.B., You can't just give that to a mailman?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, I can't trust a mailman with this. This is important.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator, G.O.B. was intrigued. He also suspected he couldn't return a completely frozen dove to a pet store and get the full refund he felt he was entitled to. 
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,G.O.B., I'll mail that letter.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator, Michael then went to confront his father.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," You're not going to keep running this company from in here, okay? That's why you wanted me to give T-Bone a job, to pay him back for burning down the storage unit?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George," Michael, that's ridiculous."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Yeah, well, I'm not hiring him. No, we don't have the money, Pop."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, There's always money in the banana stand.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," The banana stand... you know, that's exactly what this feels like. Huh? Like I'm still stuck in that hot booth all summer with you pulling the strings."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, What was I going to do? Put a kid in charge of a frozen banana stand?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Sure, that's what I did. I just made my son the manager."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, George Michael is running the frozen banana stand now?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Yeah, that's right, yeah. You sit with that, you think about that for a while."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator," George, Sr. did think about that."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Maeby," Well, now that we've got an employee, we can go have dinner. We throw away a banana for every buck we take so no one finds out."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,T-Bone," Wait a minute, I think you should do that math again."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael, Why? Is it wrong?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Maeby," It's fine. He's an arsonist, not an embezzler."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator," Meanwhile, Michael got urgent call from his mother."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille, G.O.B. is unhappy.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Again? I tried to include him, I gave him a job."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille, You gave him a letter to mail.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, And don't tell me that was too much for him?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille," No, Michael, he mailed the letter. That's not the point."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator," G.O.B. had not mailed the letter, but in an act of defiance, dramatically hurled the letter into the sea. This proved a more difficult dramatic gesture than he'd anticipated."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, So what do you want me to do about it?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille, Don't take that tone. He's my son. I want you to make him stop calling me.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay, Am I the only one who works in this family?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias," Yes, that's my gal. Who would have imagined? Two actors in one family. We're like the Lunts!"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias, Excuse me...
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator," And so, Lindsay and Maeby separately went to the same restaurant to celebrate the jobs they hadn't actually performed, with money they hadn't actually earned."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay," Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. "
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille," Not as much as you enjoyed yours. You want your belt to buckle, not your chair. "
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay," Okay, this is what I told Tobias you'd do. Say what you will about him, at least he's happy for me."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael," You know, I think we might be doubling our losses here. Because, I mean, for every dollar you take, you're actually taking two dollars because we paid for the bananas."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Maeby," (Laughs.) Oh, my God, you're right."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael," I am? Oh, God! I've screwed this up!"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael," Okay, we gotta go. Oh, my God! It's your mom and Gangee!"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Maeby, What are they doing here?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael," They're grown-ups, they're allowed to have fun whenever they want! We're kids, we're supposed to be working! "
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael," Oh, great. Now they're going to tell my dad and he's going to come check the totals and know we took the money. Oh, God, this is bad."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Maeby, Look...
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael, What are we going to do?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Maeby, Pop-Pop. He's a business man. What would he do?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Waiter #1, Bananas Foster.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille, You might want to let that fire go out before you stick your face in it.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay," Ah, that's funny. Because I was going to say, you might want to lean away from that fire since you're soaked in alcohol."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lucille, Mine was better. 
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,T-Bone," Welcome to Bluth Bananas, where bananas are our business. May I interest you in a banana this day?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," T-Bone, what are you doing here?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,T-Bone," Oh, your dad gave me this job."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator," Michael realized that his father had even taken control of the banana stand. But he still had some unanswered questions, so he did a little detective work."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, You burn down the storage unit?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,T-Bone," Oh, most definitely. "
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,G.O.B.," Michael. Having a nice day at the beach, while the rest of us are busting our asses to deliver your mail?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," What do you want me to say, okay? You go and you complained to Mom, and I tried to include you."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,G.O.B., Include me?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Yeah.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,G.O.B., I should be in charge. I'm the older brother.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Do you even want to be in charge?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,G.O.B., No... but I'd like to be asked!
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,G.O.B.," You know, it's just like when we were kids and you were the only one he let work in the banana stand."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Well, I got news for you, G.O.B. Dad still doesn't trust me to this day. Treats me like a low-level employee."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,G.O.B., It's better than being treated like a goofball. The joker... the magician.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," I thought you were going to do like a trick there, like a fireball or something."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,G.O.B.," I was, it didn't go off. These things never when you want ‘em to."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,G.O.B., My least consistent trick.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Hold on one sec. Hello?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Maeby," Hey, Uncle Michael, it's me, Maeby."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Hey, Maeby, where is George Michael?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Maeby, At the banana stand. He's about to do something really irresponsible.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, You think it's irresponsible? I'll be right there.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,T-Bone, I'm going to get blamed for this.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, George Michael?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael, Dad.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Hey, what are you doing?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael," I was just, uh... I was burning down the banana stand."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, What?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael," I'm sorry, dad, I screwed it all up. I've no right to call myself Mr. Manager."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Manager.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael," Manager. I'm sorry, dad..."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Oh, George Michael."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael," I am, I mean, but listen, I'll make it up to you. I mean, I'll work weeknights. I'll lay people off. I'll give up my summer, all my summers. Just, just tell me what to do, and I'll do it. "
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator, Michael realized he had done to his son what his father had done to him. So he came up with a solution.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Burn it down.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George Michael, What?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Let's burn this son of a bitch. It's going to be our best summer ever, buddy."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator," And so Michael, his son and his brother, together enjoyed the cathartic burning of the banana stand."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," You mailed that insurance check, right, G.O.B.?"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator," The next morning, Lindsay woke up late in the day, hung over from celebrating her one day of employment, which it turns out, she had slept through."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Roger Danish," ..all right, Lindsay, forget it. We'll get someone else."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator," Tobias was next on the call list, but unfortunately, couldn't hear the phone over the sound of the shower."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator," He did, however, use Lindsay's conditioner and was surprised to find that it did help his self-esteem."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay, You look nice.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias, What?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Lindsay, You look very handsome today.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Tobias," Thank you, Lindsay."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator, And Michael finally got to show his father who's boss.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, You what?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Burned it right down to the ground.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, Are you crazy? There was money in that banana stand.
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael," Well, it's all gone now, Dad, and it was my decision. So next time you want to have a little power struggle, just remember that you're playing with fire."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George," There was $250,000 lining the walls of the banana stand."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, What?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George," Cash, Michael!"
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Michael, Why didn't you tell me that?
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George," How much clearer can I say, ""There's always money in the banana stand!"""
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Guard, No touching!
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,George, No touching!

1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,Narrator," ... and Michael, realizing the banana stand is the only profitable part of the Bluth Empire, decides to rebuild."
1,Top Banana,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Top_Banana,G.O.B., Couldn't have called me? I can't swing a hammer? I got a rabbit to buy.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," Now the story of the family who lost everything, and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together. It's Arrested Development."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," It was Sunday morning, and Michael was making cornballs, a Bluth family favorite since George Sr. unsuccessfully tried to market the device in the mid-'70s."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,"George, Sr."," Time to pull out the basket, and we dig into some hot... Son of a bitch!"

1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,"George, Sr."," I'll plop you, you mincing little... "
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator, It was a ritual Michael shared with his son before their weekly bike ride to Balboa Island.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," Today's the big... Careful, don't touch that. Never touch that. I'm really looking forward to our ride today. We better go extra hard to work off these cornballs. "
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay, Or you could not eat the cornballs and let your kid lead his own life.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Please. He loves this. Am I right?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael," Actually, uh... I can't really go today."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, How's that?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael, My-my bike needs a tune-up or something.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Let's not blame the bike. Okay? It's a poor carpenter that blames his shoddy tools for the... Ow! (bleep) Oh! Stupid...
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael, You okay?

1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay, Getting too old for his daddy?

1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay," Oh, yeah, don't worry about it. I paid for it myself."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, With what?

1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Get a job.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,G.O.B.," Michael. Hey, the Cornballer. I thought these were only legal in Mexico."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," In fact, the Cornballer wasn't legal anywhere, but George Sr. continued to market it there successfully."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Dubbed voice, ¡Muy delicioso!
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Richard Simmons, ¡Es verdad!
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Dubbed voice, ¡Soy loco por los Cornballs!
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Where'd you come from?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,G.O.B., I had another big fight with Marta.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," G.O.B. had been having an on-again, off-again relationship with Marta, a Spanish-language soap opera star."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,G.O.B., It looks like I'm going to be staying here for a while.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," No, it doesn't. It doesn't look like that. I've got a full house here, G.O.B."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay," He's just in a bad mood, G.O.B., because his son feels suffocated by him."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Suffocated? Really?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay," Yes, Michael, he's a teenager. He's probably got a little girlfriend, and... well, let's face it, you are overbearing."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," Oh, maybe I should be a little bit more like you when it comes to parenting, huh? No borders, no limits, ""Go ahead, touch the Cornballer, you know best."""
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias," Michael, if I could, uh, stick my pretty little nose in here for one second. When I was a psychiatrist- and this is before I became an actor..."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay, You're still not an actor.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias," (Chuckles.) Lovely. ...I saw a lot of this type of behavior, and I think what you're experiencing is your son's very normal need to distance himself from his overbearing father. Am I touching something? (Gasps.) Hot. Hot, hot. Hot."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Be careful.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias," (Quietly.) Hot, hot, hot..."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, You all right?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias," Hi-yat. Now, take my daughter, for example. She lives her life, and... I get the pleasure of guessing what that might entail. Now... watch this- Maeby! Where are you off to on this glorious Sunday afternoon? She won't tell me."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Maeby, I'm going to audition for a play.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias," Well, that time it didn't work."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias, What-what play?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Maeby, It's for high school. You can't audition.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias, I was totally wrong. She's reaching out to her actor daddy.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias, Does anyone have an ice pack?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," In truth, Maeby was reaching out to a boy named Steve Holt, who was auditioning for the lead in the school play."

1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," George Michael also chose to audition, looking for a chance to get closer to his cousin Maeby."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael," I would kiss before I spoke... And then there's a kiss, right?"

1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," Michael went to get his son a new bike to keep him from slipping away, while Michael's mother was giving up hope that her son Buster would ever leave her side."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, Zip me up.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," Usually at this time of year, Buster would return to his postgraduate studies but without the resources to afford it his summer vacation was extending into the fall and Lucille was beginning to resent it."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster, Mom! Mom!
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, What?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay," Hi, Mama. It's Linds."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, It'll fly out on its own! Why are you calling me? What do you need?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay," Oh, very nice, Mom. I don't need anything. My daughter needs some new school clothes."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, Buster!
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster, It's a bird!
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, I know it's a bird. I'm on the phone!
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster, It walked on my pillow! 
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille," Look, I have a child that costs me money, too, you know. Why can't you get a job?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay, What is it with this family and working? Michael just gave me the exact same lecture in front of everybody.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, Everybody?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, Who-who's ev... Who's everybody?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay," You know, the kids, G.O.B., Tobias- everybody."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille," He didn't invite Buster. Buster's his brother, too. What's wrong with Buster?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," And even as she asked the question, Lucille realized that perhaps it was time to let her own baby bird fly away."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Why do I have to take him?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille," Because he's your brother, and you run around with everyone else, going on bike rides, making cornholes. Everyone's laughing and riding and cornholing except Buster. And I know he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but he's sensitive, Michael, and you could pretend to be interested in him. "
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," Fine, he can hang out, but he's going to work, okay? This is not going to be a day at the beach."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster," Th-That's cool, that's cool. Mom-Mom packed me a change of clothes."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," So, Buster stayed, and Michael made him build the new bike."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, It's in that big box in my office.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,G.O.B., Hey. Michael.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," G.O.B., what are you doing here, and why are you in a bathrobe?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,G.O.B., What's he doing here? Why is he in his bathing suit?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster, Mom dropped me off to spend time with Michael.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,G.O.B., Spend time with Michael or to serve her own menopausal needs?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster, (Chuckles.) Yeah. Mom's awesome. Maybe we should call her. 
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," So, why are you in your robe?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,G.O.B.," I camped out in the boardroom last night. What with you kicking me out of your house, there are few places left that you have that I can stay."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," Mm. Well, you can't stay here, either."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,G.O.B.," Let me ask you something. Is this a business decision, or is it personal? 'Cause if it's business, I'll go away happily. But if it's personal, I'll go away, but I won't be happy."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, It's personal.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster, I am so sorry.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," Michael's son, meanwhile, was waiting with his cousin for their first rehearsal."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Maeby, I'm surprised you tried out for this.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael," Yeah, I just love the theater."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Maeby, That's great. I'm just doing it to kiss Steve Holt.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael," I actually think I'm going to quit. Yeah, theater's dead."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Maeby," But... he's always going to be at football practice, so I'm going to have to kiss the stand-in."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael," But no... no. I love the theater, and I gave my word, so I'm back in."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," Tobias, meanwhile, stopped by the school."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias, (Whispers.) I know why you're doing this.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Maeby, Dad! What are you doing here? Go away.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias," Yes, because the director might be here soon, right? Oops, too late. He's already here. Hello, everyone, and welcome to the theater. I am Dr. Tobias Fünke, and I will be your new... director. "
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Maeby, Oh... my God.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator, Tobias had gotten the directing job by meeting with the school principal.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias," And you tell me you've got some P.E. teacher directing? That just makes me want to puke all over your head, sir. Give me a chance to tell the Bard's tale, and I give you my word on humble knee, whence you shall not say it wasn't e'er to be."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Administrator," Jerry, you cool with this?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Coach Jerry," Sure, let the little fruit do it."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias, Huzzah! 
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," As the days went by, Buster's apprenticeship was proving more trying than Michael had anticipated."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, We're excited. We want your business.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," And, uh, everybody at the Bluth Company is committed..."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster, Here I go again.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator, And just when he could take no more...
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," ...and we're back on track, and we're focused, and... Buster! You can't do that in the snack room, pal?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster, Mom told me to stay away from microwaves. 
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster," And besides, this is going to be the most bitchin'ly fast bike in all of Orange County."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Really?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster, Your son is gonna love it.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael,40 is as good a time as any to call it a day.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," So, Michael left for the high school, hoping to reconnect with his son, while Tobias' attempts to reconnect with his daughter hit a snag."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael, I will stop your mouth.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias, Stop! Stop it! It's all wrong.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael, But we were just about to do the kiss.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias, Kiss- I know. It doesn't work.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias," Look, you are playing adults... Pick that up. Pick that up, please. ...with fully formed libidos, not two young men playing grab-ass in the shower. Would you hold the work, please?! Oh, Michael. "
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael," Dad, what...?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," So, you're in a play, huh?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Maeby, I'm not. I quit.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias, Maeby...
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Why didn't you tell me?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael," Well, it's not really important. I'm just a stand-in."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," And you're ashamed. Well, this should cheer you up. Hm? I left work early. I thought maybe we'd go for a ride today."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael," Wha...? No, I can't go on a bike ride right now."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Why because of the play? You're just the stand-in.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael," No, no, it's not the play, it's just... you know, I can't go on a million bike rides whenever you want me to, you know?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," Wait a minute, wait a minute, hey. Is it... is it about a girl?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael," No, it's not... No, just drop it, Dad."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Was Lindsay is right? Am I really suffocating him?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias," Well, they're different people every day, teenagers- hormones all ablaze. Except, of course, when they're on stage when I need it."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, No. He said it wasn't about a girl.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Maybe he really is pulling away.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias, Not a girl? Ah... of course. Methinks a Cupid I shall play. 
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," Tobias came up with a new plan for the play, and a way to connect to George Michael."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias, I know why you're in the play.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael, What?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias," Watch this. Okay, everybody. Well, we've lost a leading lady, but did you know that in Shakespeare's day, that the women's roles were played by men? Fancy that! George Michael, you know Steven's lines, yes?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael, Sort of.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias," Fine, then you are my Benedict."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias, And Steven Holt... Where is Steven Holt?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Steve Holt, Steve Holt!
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias," Yes. Get ready for the acting challenge of your sweet young life, fair lady, for you are my Beatrice!"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Steve Holt, Beatrice!
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias," Let's take it from, ""Peace, I will stop thy mouth."" And now we'll see if some sparks fly."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," As George Michael contemplated kissing his rival, Michael sought his father's advice."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,"George, Sr."," Well, you think you never hurt me?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, What are you talking about? When have I ever rebelled?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,"George, Sr."," I never see you anymore, Michael."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, You're in prison. And I was here yesterday.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,"George, Sr."," Oh, yeah, that's... that's... I'm sorry. I couldn't break away from the poker game. Capital-G was down to his boxers."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Strip poker?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,"George, Sr."," Yeah, and it's tough. We can really only play about... two hands. "
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,"George, Sr.", Listen... Let him go. Let your son go.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," I can't do that, Dad. He needs me."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,"George, Sr."," Michael, you don't want to make the same mistake your mom made with Buster."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," Yeah, boy. What happened there?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,"George, Sr."," I really don't know. Maybe it was the eleven months he spent in the womb. The doctor said there were claw marks on the walls of her uterus. But he was her ""miracle baby."" And I-I was just too burnt out on raising you guys to care. So... he turned out a little soft, you know, a little doughy. I don't know, maybe it was my fault. Maybe, uh, maybe I just ignored the guy. "
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster," Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? "
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," Yeah, I got to let my son go."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," Lindsay, meanwhile, still had the dress. And she was starting to get some positive reactions to it."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay, Look at you! I am!

1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille," Staying here? What, did that Mexican throw you out?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,G.O.B.," She's not ""that Mexican,"" Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Colombian or something. Anyway, it's over."

1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster, And you might be [bleep] and it's going to [bleep].
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that. "

1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias," Oh, well, he didn't want to rehearse today. But I-I do think I have a handle on what he's going through. I wish I could say the same for Steve Holt, though. I don't know what the hell her problem is."

1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay, I'm exhausted.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," Neiman's again, huh?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay," Actually, I've been going to the thrift store but I'm going to find a way to keep that dress, Michael."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,G.O.B., Things didn't work out with Mom. It was utterly macabre. 
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, Zip me up.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,G.O.B., She always makes everything about her.

1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, What?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay," Hi, Mama, it's Linds."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, Get a job.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay," Look, just hear me out. It's Maeby's dress. It was stolen from her locker. They beat her up, and, uh, and took all her clothes."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille," Send her over, I'll take her shopping."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay," Buster was right. You get off on being withholding, don't you?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, Buster said that?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay, That's right.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, My Buster?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lindsay," Not anymore, apparently."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," While Lucille was missing her youngest son, Michael was finally enjoying his company."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Zip me up?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," And while Buster did build a faster bike, he neglected to build the brakes."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster, I'm flying!
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Buster?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator, And George Michael had news for Maeby.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael," So, I quit the play. I don't really like plays. Also, I think your dad thinks I'm gay."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Maeby," Oh, he thinks everyone's gay. "
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael," So, uh, do you want to get a soda?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Maeby, I can't. I'm actually back in the play. We're in the middle of dress rehearsal right now.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael, But I thought Steve had your part.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," Steve did still have Maeby's part, and Tobias had given Maeby a new part."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Maeby, So you want me to play the man?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Tobias, Yes. Don't you see? I-I cast the parts all wrong. It was Daddy's fault.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Maeby," And I still get to kiss Steve, right?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Maeby, It's going to be a huge disaster. I'll get you tickets.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator, And Michael tried to salvage what was left of the day with what was left of his brother.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster," I'm a little shaky, but... but we're here to work."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, Michael.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," Mom, what are you doing here?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille," Oh, hello, Buster. Here's a candy bar. No, I'm withholding it. Look at me, ""getting off."" "
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, How dare you turn Buster against me?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, What are you talking about?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, I know what you've all been saying. But I'm not going to let you destroy my relationship with my son just because you don't have one with yours right now.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," Wait a minute. Me and my son are fine, and that is not what this is. Buster is a grown man. He can make his own decisions. Why don't you ask Buster what he wants?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster, Michael. I want to go with Mom.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, You said that she shoots you down.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster, I was just trying to fit in.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," You were flying today, buddy."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster," Yes, I was flying. But a little too close to the sun."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, You let him go in the sun? 
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille, Get in the back seat. I'll be right out.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster," Front seat, Mom. I sit in the front seat now. Mmm?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille," Let me tell you something, Michael. You have to fight for your family. If you were smart, you'd grab your son before he slips any further away."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," Well, I disagree, Mom. I'm not going to control George Michael, I'm going to let him decide for himself what's best."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Lucille," Mm-hmm. Well, you better hope that little bird decides to fly back into your house, because they usually don't."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Employee," So, uh, can we go now?"
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Yeah.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator," And George Michael watched as Maeby shared the kiss that should have been his with the boy he almost had to kiss. But, to Maeby's surprise, she did not enjoy kissing Steve Holt."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Maeby, You smell like my mom.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Narrator, And Michael returned to the model home to find his son in the kitchen.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael," Hey, Dad."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, You're home.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael," Yeah, I was waiting for you. I thought we could make some of these."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Sure.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael, I'm sorry about what I said at the school. It was out of line.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, I shouldn't have poked my nose into your life.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael, My life?
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," Well, I know that you're growing up."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael," Yeah, but, Dad, you're like the most important part of my life."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, That's a little cornball.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael, I don't mind.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael," I don't mind either, buddy."
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael, Watch it.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, Mother of God! Oh! Every damn time!
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,George Michael, Here.
1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Michael, This is a big one. Oh!

1,Bringing Up Buster,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Bringing_Up_Buster,Buster, I can't get down.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator, Michael Bluth arrived home to find the rental car his sister Lindsay had promised to return.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Lindsay, you have to cut back on everything. Okay? I'm even selling the corporate jet."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay," Great, so now we don't have a car or a jet? Why don't we just take an ad out in I'm Poor magazine? "
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Look, I'm trying to get development started. All right? I've got six guys on bulldozers waiting to get under way."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay, Bulldozing?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, Yeah.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay," Well, what about the trees?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Oh, we're just gonna cover them with blankets."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, I'm ripping them out.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay," Anything for a buck, right? You are so materialistic."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, Don't suddenly turn this into one of your causes.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay," It's not sudden, Michael. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, I'll never forget your wedding. 
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay, I care deeply for nature.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, You're wearing ostrich-skin boots.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay," Well, I don't care about ostriches. "
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," You're looking at a desperate man, Michael."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, Do you need money?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," What I need is freedom. Marta is being interviewed today on TV about her show ""El Amor Prohibido"". I mean, it's bad enough that I gotta go to the awards show tomorrow night. Today I gotta stand next to her like I'm Rita Wilson."

1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," G.O.B., you've found a woman who believes in you. You should make a commitment to her because life is short. Listen to me. I would give anything to be able to have that again, you know?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, A family. Nothing else matters.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille, Michael?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, It's Mom. Hide.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., You brought up money earlier I actually would like to borrow some.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, No.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille, Michael?

1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., Give it to me.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille," G.O.B., wait, I need those tickets. He promised me tickets to his girlfriend's award show."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, You're going to that thing?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille," Well, my dear friend, Lucille Austero, is part-owner of a television station and I want to show up and hold my head high. I may not have her money anymore, but at least I have a live husband."

1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, Buster.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Buster," Hey, brother. Mom said you could tie this for me."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille, Make it long so Buster doesn't seem so... round.

1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Buster, Well... we're not dating.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Nonetheless, come here, shouldn't Buster be spending his evenings with women that aren't so much... his mother?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille, He's a beautiful boy. They don't appreciate him. It's his glasses. They make him look like a lizard. Plus he's self-conscious. 
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Gee, I wonder why?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille, You're one to talk.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille, When's the last time you went on a date?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, I just haven't met anybody who's not completely self-absorbed and impossible to have a conversation with.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille," If that's a veiled criticism about me, I won't hear it and I won't respond to it. "
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, Hmm. Maybe I'm wrong.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator," Later that day, Michael finalized the sale of the corporate jet and was also able to solve the family's transportation problem."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay, I am not riding in that thing.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Well, we sold the jet What am I going to do? Besides, Lindsay, it's not like you're materialistic. Well, then, it's all yours."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, Watch out for bridges and hop-ons. You're going to get some hop-ons. 
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator, And Michael was finally prepared to begin the next phase of the family business.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,John Beard, We go to Trisha Thoon for more.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Trisha Thoon," An activist known as Johnny Bark has taken residence in this beloved tree, and refuses to come down. What is he protesting? The expansion of high-cost, low-quality mini-mansions, like this one here."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, You got to be kidding me.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator, Michael met with his sister about the activist in the tree.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay, You want me to get him out?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Come on, it's one tree. Listen, after we get that lot cleared, we're going to have enough money for you to neuter thousands of animals. You can make dogs and cats a complete thing of the past. No more dogs and cats. And we will have enough money for me to replace the stair car with a normal car."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay, I'll do it for the cats. 
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator," Meanwhile, Marta's interview was underway and G.O.B. was getting uncomfortable playing the supportive role."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Marta," I just told them that we are this family now, and that a career is one thing, but family is forever."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," I, too, have an announcement to make. To prove that no prison can hold me, I will incarcerate myself in the penitentiary that holds my own father, only to escape 24 hours later. No shackles can hold these hands. Say that to them in Spanish. "
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator," The next day, Michael got a call to meet G.O.B. at the prison."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, You're going into prison? I thought there was something wrong with Dad.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," What? No, Dad's fine. I just saw him out there throwing a ball around with a couple of guys. Which, of course, he never did with me."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, How'd you even get them to agree to this?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," Oh, the warden's a fan."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Warden Buck, You really think you can break out of my prison?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., You won't even know I was here.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator," The warden was intrigued- Less about the stunt, and more about the prison beatings this brash magician was sure to receive. "
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Warden Buck," Any press is good press, huh?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator," And so, G.O.B. went about swallowing the key to prepare for his escape."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," Then I pass the key, bust out of prison, and into magic history. Of course, that is going to conflict with my going to the Desis with Marta."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Well, life's a compromise. I probably would have taken her to the nice event, but, prison will be fun, too. "
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., Thank you. I knew you'd come through.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Come through? How'd I come through? G.O.B., how'd I come through?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," You might want to find something a little stronger, Warden. Oh, what is your problem?"

1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay, Get out of our [bleep]ing tree.

1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., I thought you said throwing the ball against the garage door by yourself was how you got accuracy. 
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,"George, Sr."," G.O.B., what are you doing here?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," Life, Dad. I killed a guy. No. It's just a publicity stunt. I'll bust out of here tomorrow. Impressive, no?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,"George, Sr."," You idiot, you're gonna get yourself killed."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize there weren't any magic fans here."

1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Marta, Thank you so much for taking me to the awards. G.O.B. said he really appreciated you coming through for him.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Oh, sure. Yeah. This is how I came through, huh? Listen, Marta..."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Marta, And I hope you don't mind driving. I-I took a cab here.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Marta, I just couldn't find my keys.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Well, my brother may have eaten them. "
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, Look... Um... I haven't hired a limo or anything.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Marta, I don't mind.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, I think you might.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay," Look, I'm an activist, too, and I appreciate what you're doing for the environment. But we're not the only ones who destroy trees. What about beavers? You call yourself an environmentalist. Why don't you go out and club some beavers? "
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Johnny Bark," You don't really ""get"" nature, do you?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay, It will be torn down- with or without you. Where are the stairs?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator," Meanwhile, the Desis were under way."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Everado," ...Guillermo Ortiz, como El Raton. Pablo Dominguez, como Pepito, Felicio Colon, como Miguelito..."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator, And Lucille was mingling with the elite of the Latino Television Academy.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille," Can I get a vodka tonic, please? I'd like a vodka tonic, please. Vodka tonic, please. A sea of waiters and no one will take a drink order. "
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator," Buster was also mingling, but at Lucille's insistence, wasn't wearing his glasses."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Buster, ¿Como estoy? Exciting night. 
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator, And Lucille Bluth crossed paths with Lucille Austero.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille 2, Lucille? Lucille! Aren't you something? Showing up here without your husband. Shame be damned. Caution to the wind.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille," That's so sweet, darling. I'm here to support you. You're the one who's all alone and likely to stay that way. My husband's just a phone call away."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille 2," That's one call per day, isn't it? Gee, I should think he'd want to save that for his lawyer."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille," At least he's in prison, not an urn. "
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille 2, You are so deliciously witty.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille," Oh, aren't we having fun?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator, The other Lucille also suffers from severe vertigo.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator," Lucille Austero, meanwhile, perhaps because she'd never seen him without his glasses, first took notice of Buster. Buster, however, failed to notice her and she sent him a proposition."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Waiter #2," Excuse me, sir. This is for you."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator, Finally Marta's category was announced.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Everado, Y el Desi va a... Sandra Elena Higuera!
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, Marta. Hey... I'm sorry. You really deserved to win in there. Did you win? I don't speak Spanish...
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Marta," It's not about the award. It's crazy, but I thought it would make G.O.B. proud..."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, I'm sure in his own way...
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Marta," No, I just think he doesn't understand family. You know? Commitment. But those are the only things that matter in life."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator," At that moment, Michael realized that this was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen, and for the first time since he lost his wife, he wanted someone. At the same moment, G.O.B. was ready to retrieve the key to execute his escape."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., Is there a private bathroom nearby?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,"George, Sr.", You're looking at it.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," No, no, no. I can't use that. I need privacy. Yeah, I've always been that way. I can't go without privacy. I can't pass this key without privacy."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,"George, Sr."," Well, I could ask the guys to leave, but, uh... you know, they've been locking the doors lately. I don't know."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., I've made a huge mistake. 
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator," Michael was having a wonderful time with Marta and didn't want the evening to end, while Lindsay was bonding with the man in the tree."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Johnny Bark, You have no idea what it's like to save a living thing.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay," For your information, I do. My husband Tobias and I used to do this kind of thing all the time. I guess that's why I was so attracted to him. He was a serious and committed advocate for change."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Johnny Bark, Where is he now?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay, He's at a weekend stage-fighting workshop with Carl Weathers. 
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay, But he used to believe in things. We both used to.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Sorry, Lindsay. I didn't realize you were up there."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay," Oh, I'm up here, Mike. And I'm not coming down. I'm going to save this tree, no matter what it takes!"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, Okay. I'll see you when you realize what that bucket's for.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,George Michael," You know, I can see why your mom likes it. It is a really nice tree..."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Maeby, We've got to get it torn down.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,George Michael, ...that must die. Stupid tree.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille, Buster's out of control!
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," What, another panic attack?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Buster, Me? No. She's just wigged out because I have a girlfriend.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille," A waiter hands him a note, suddenly he's Steve McQueen."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille, He doesn't even know what she looks like.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Buster, I know she's a brownish area. With points. And I know I love her! 
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille, I'm calling Dr. Miller.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Buster," Okay, I don't know I love her. But I cannot tell you how liberating it is to be with someone who's not Mom... who's nothing like her."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Yeah, and you're just jumping right into this, huh?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Buster," Oh, yes, yes. That's what you do when life hands you a chance to be with someone special. You just grab that... that brownish area by its points and you don't let go no matter what your mom says. "
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, Good talk.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, Hello?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," Michael! Change of escape plans. I unplugged the ice cream sandwich machine and the guards are all eating them before they get too melty, so I've got like a half an hour. Meet me at the south prison wall and bring the stairs."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator, Michael knew he had an obligation to his brother.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., Michael!
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Hey, G.O.B.!"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., Where the hell are the stairs?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Oh, I thought you were kidding."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Hey, speaking of kidding, How serious are you about Marta? I get the sense that there's not much of a future there. Am I reading that right?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., Let me ask you something. How would you feel if I came down on you hard?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, You're saying I'm not reading this right.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," No, I'm saying move the bike. I need to jump on you to break my fall. "
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," G.O.B., don't be an idiot. Don't jump on me."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," No, I have to. Come on. Stop moving."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Come on, don't jump on me."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator, The guards soon became concerned about the paperwork that would be required of them if G.O.B. actually did jump.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," You're making this very, very difficult. Oh, God... this is personal."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael, G.O.B.! G.O.B.! Good talk.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., I'm a complete failure.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,"George, Sr.", Where'd you get that kind of talk?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., From you. You always say that about me. 
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,"George, Sr."," Well, maybe you're not entirely to blame. I haven't always been the best kind of father either."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," Dad, you've done a pretty good job of being a father to everybody in here. What have they got that I don't? I mean. you've never even... thrown a ball around with me."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,"George, Sr.", Great. Now you're an athlete. 
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator, Lindsay left the tree to sleep in her own bed. And Johnny Bark left the tree to awaken her.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Johnny Bark," So, Lindsay... I was thinking..."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay, Johnny Bark?!
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Johnny Bark," I want to be with you, Lindsay. And I know you want to be with me, too."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay," No, I don't."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Johnny Bark, But... all the things you said about commitment and believing in things. That's the way I feel.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay," Johnny, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to lead you on. I think you're gross."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lindsay, Uh-oh.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Johnny Bark, My tree. That's why you never get out of the tree.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator, And G.O.B. was about to get a reason to stay in prison.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,"George, Sr.", You all right?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., Not great.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,"George, Sr.", Maybe this will help.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator," And for the first time, G.O.B. had the game of catch with his father he'd been waiting for his whole life."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,"George, Sr."," Okay, ready? Put your mitt up. There you go."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,White Power Bill, White Power!
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., I'm... white. 
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator, And Michael decided to share his feelings with Marta.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Marta, Michael.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Marta. I'm not really quite sure how to say this, but, uh..."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Uh, I had a great time last night."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Marta," I did, too."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," And, um..."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," We're so in synch on so many things, and, uh, I... You guys don't have a machine, huh?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Marta, I'm sorry. (Into telephone.) Hello.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Marta," Oh, my God! G.O.B. has been stabbed in the back."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., Am I still in prison?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille, You're in the hospital.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., Ta-da. 
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator," Meanwhile, Buster was waiting in the hallway."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille 2, Buster?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Buster, Miss Austero. What... what are you doing here?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille 2, A touch of the dizzies.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Buster, Oh.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille 2," So, listen, Buster, have you given any, uh... thought to my offer?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Buster, I'm sorry. What?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille 2," Well, I mean, my phone hasn't made a peep."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Buster," Has your hair always been that pointy, Miss Austero? "
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille 2, It's Lucille.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Buster," Right, right. That's my mom's name."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille 2, (Laughing.) Yes.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Buster," Oh, God."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille 2, Buster? Hel... I'm all right. I'm all right...
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille, He's fine. I'll be in the hospital bar.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Uh, you know there isn't a hospital bar, Mother."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille," Well, this is why people hate hospitals. "
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," You were right, Michael. Life is too short. Mine almost ended today. So, I think I'm going to work things out with Marta."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," You are, huh? Boy, that's, uh... That's great."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," Hmm, you know what's funny? I was going to walk out of that prison last night and break up with her. Good thing you didn't bring the stairs, huh?"
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Hmm, very funny. Yeah, it's hysterical. I'm lucky. Hey."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Marta, Can I come in now?
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Yeah, sure. He's fine."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Marta, Listen... I really appreciate you... helping me out last night.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Michael," Well, you know, you've got to put family first. That's the stupid thing that I believe."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B.," Hey, you two keep on talking out there I'm going to start getting jealous."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Marta, I was really worried about you.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., You've got nothing to worry about. We're going to be together for a long time.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Marta, We're a family now. I am so happy. I'm going to call the kids.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., I've made a huge mistake.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, G.O.B. learns how he survived his stabbing."
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Surgeon, Looks like the shiv would have done some real damage if it hadn't been for this. It was in your lower intestine.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,G.O.B., So close.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Narrator, And Buster makes a bold move.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Lucille 2, Buster.
1,Key Decisions,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Key_Decisions,Buster, Let's go for it.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator, Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together. It's Arrested Development.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," Michael Bluth always rode his bike to work, but the recent heat wave had taken some of the fun out of it. It had also caused problems in his presentation to the Bluth Company investors."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Investor, So there's no screwups with the permits this time?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," The permits have been filed absolutely on time. You have my word on that. Um, tell you what. Let me get some of this... Well... Well, as you... The important part is here."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Kitty," Bye, you guys. Really great to see you again. They think you're full of (bleep). I think it's the sweating."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, I've got to get a car.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Kitty, Don't worry. I told them the truth.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, That I rode here on a bike?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Kitty, That the permits weren't filed.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, But my dad filed the permits before he went to jail.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Kitty, He most certainly did not.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," So, I just lied to the investors?"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Kitty, You most certainly did.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," That's really great. Well, I've got to ride my bike out to the prison and talk to my dad about this. That'll be fun in hundred-degree heat."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Kitty, Why don't you just take your dad's car?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," No, Dad would never go for that."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator, George Sr. had always been overprotective of his cars.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr.", There's no ice cream in the car.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, I'll be careful.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr."," All right, this is what we're going to do. Careful, Michael. Oh!"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Kitty, Whatever you think.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Yeah.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Kitty, But I did see G.O.B. driving it last week.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Wait. Honestly? G.O.B.'s driving the car?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Kitty, I'm not the liar.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," Michael wanted his father's car, so he went to confront his brother G.O.B."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," Give me a ""G.O.B."""
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,George Michael, G.O.B.! 
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," No, I didn't mean for you to yell my name at me. It's what I call a double-dipped banana with everything on it."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," Hey, I can't believe you. I asked you two weeks ago whether we should use Dad's car and you said it would be ""bad form."" Now I hear you're driving it."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B., That is a lie. A bald-faced lie.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator, G.O.B. was lying. He had been driving his father's car.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," Look, why don't you just take your precious portable stairway vehicle you're always trying to convince us is a car?"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," Yeah, that would be great, except our brother-in-law left it in an airport parking lot."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," From whence it came, huh? "
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," In fact, Tobias had intended to park the family's only vehicle at the airport parking lot, but was waved onto the tarmac instead, where he found a spot close to his gate."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,George Michael," Here you go, Uncle G.O.B. I had to use two sticks just to support all the extra chocolate and nuts."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," Hey, hey, hey, whoa. Two sticks and extra chocolate? Is it Mardi Gras? "
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, What are you charging for that?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,George Michael, He doesn't like to discuss money.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B., I don't like to discuss money. 
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, What does that mean? You're paying for that.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," A Bluth banana? No, I hadn't planned on it."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," But I'll tell you what. If you want to use my likeness for a Hamburglar-type character, I'll sign off on that. ""Mr. Banana Grabber"" or something. "
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," No, no. No more banana grabbing, no more car grabbing."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," Throw that away, please."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,George Michael, But it's already made.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," I don't care. Nobody gets it now, okay? Are you happy?"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B., My own brother. Michael. My own selfish brother. Michael.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, All right. I do not want you to get upset. He did not mean that. He says things that he doesn't...
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B., Selfish Michael.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," He did not mean that, either."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator, Michael then went to his sister to find his father's car.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay, What car? I don't know what you're talking about.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," Dad's car. The one you didn't tell me that you had, even though I had to ride my bicycle to work all week."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay," Oh, Dad's car. Well, obviously I'm going to use it if it's an emergency."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator, Lindsay had such an emergency three days earlier when her salon was able to squeeze her in at the last moment.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay, (Gasps.) That color's discontinued!
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay, I had to get ready for the bachelorette auction.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, The bachelorette auction? You know you're married.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay, You just go to dinner with the guy. It's for charity.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," That's what you said about posing for the Ladies of Literacy Calendar. The one with the pictures of all the 30-year-old women in lingerie with their nipples covered by copies of Oliver Twist. Yeah, that made a big difference for the young ones."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay, It would have if it didn't get banned from the schools. 
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," Come on, face it. You just do all this charity crap just to stroke your ego. You don't even know what the auction's for tonight."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay, The wetlands.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, To do what with them?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay, Dry them.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Save them.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay," From drying. Which is more than you would ever do. I mean, you're like the least-charitable person I know. "
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, I don't do anything for myself. Everything that I do is for this family.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay," Oh, you don't do it for us, Michael. You just do it because you love being the guy in charge. 'Cause you love saying no. Like you said to G.O.B. when he wanted a frozen banana. And even after he gave you the rights to his ""Mr. Banana-Grabber"" character."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," All right, you know what? I will start doing my charity work when you start doing yours. In the meantime, where's the car?"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay, I think Buster has it. I don't know. It's on the schedule.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, There is a schedule? I've always tried so hard not to look at this thing.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator, So Michael went to find Buster.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille, Who let you in?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Your new cleaning woman. What happened to Luz?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille," Supposedly, Luz had to take her daughter to the hospital. That's Lupe, her sister."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, I hope she's okay.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille, She's awful. Can barely wash a dish. 
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille, Uh-oh. She better not walk through here after she's been in there. Tell me you've got an exit strategy.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Mother...
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille," Oh, please. They didn't sneak into this country to be your friends. "
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Wow.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille," Don't you judge me. You're the selfish one. You're the one who charged his own brother for a Bluth frozen banana. I mean, it's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars? "
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," You've never actually set foot in a supermarket, have you?"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille, I don't have time for this. I've got to get ready for the bachelorette auction.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, You're doing that? You can't possibly tell me that you care about the wetlands.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille, I care about going for more money than Lucille Austero.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," In fact, Lucille Bluth had made sure of that."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille 2, Lucille!
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille, I got you tickets to The Producers. I already saw it in New York. But that's of no use to a woman whose vertigo makes flying a grotesque misadventure.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille 2, You must have scrimped and saved for these. But isn't this the night of the auction?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille, Is it?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, You seem pretty confident.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille," Oh, I think there's a certain bachelor who won't mind coming home with me at the end of the evening."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Buster.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille, Where did he go? Buster! Why do you hide every time the doorbell rings?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Buster, I'm not hiding.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator, Buster was hiding from Lucille Austero. After inadvertently flirting with her at a social event while not wearing his glasses. And Lucille had been pursuing him ever since.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille 2," Buster, hi. It's me again. I've still got those Producers tickets, and I'd love to share them with you. I don't want you to think I'm taking this more seriously than you are, unless you're planning some grand romantic gesture, my feelings are just the teensiest bit hurt."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille, What are you going to do?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Buster, Bid on you.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille, How much?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Buster,"$10,000.00 "
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille, When?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Buster, When they call my name.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille," No, they're not going to call your name. They're going to call my name. Good grief."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," Hey, Busty, have you been using Dad's car?"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Buster," No. Well, yes."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, You got the keys?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Buster, Probably in my school pants.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Okay.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Buster, I have been a part of this archaeological dig. We think we found a part of a pterodactyl under Fashion Island.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Buster, That was 90% gravity. 
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Buster," It is my day on the schedule, but I guess you get them first."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Yeah.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Buster, Wait. I need my rape whistle back. 
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Did you get all your stuff out of the car?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Buster," Yeah, I left my homework in the back seat, but I can get it later."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Okay. Okay.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Buster, Help.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," The partially excavated skull, the spilled nail polish, the burned seats and he came to an important decision."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," I'm getting some ice cream, I can tell you that right now."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," Michael, now able to drive to prison, confronted his father about the permits."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, How come you didn't tell me that you didn't file them?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr.", I'm under a lot of pressure here. I'm trying to get my newsletter off the ground. I'm trying to decide which gang to align myself with. 
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Is it pledge week already?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr."," I've got it down to two. But honestly, I don't even want to choose. I just feel... I feel like the prettiest girl at the dance."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr."," Hey, listen, about that permit thing, that's an easy fix. Just break into the permit office, slip the application into the next file and then tell them ""Hey, you guys screwed up."""
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," I'm not doing that, Dad."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr."," Michael, you lied to your investors. You got to make that right."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr.", Call G.O.B. He'll handle it. That's what he's for.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, That's what he's for?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr."," You better tell him I'm asking. I don't thing he's going to do it for you after you wouldn't even give him a frozen banana, Michael."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Is there a chat room that you guys all...?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr.", Not charitable.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Never mind. I'll tell G.O.B. that you want him to do this.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr.", Okay. I've got a dance I got to get ready for.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," Whoa, there's really a dance?"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr.", I don't know. Both sides are making a lot of promises.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," You should call this a ""G.O.B.,"" guy."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," G.O.B., can I talk to you for a sec? Listen, um... I'm really sorry about before. I said some things, and I got a little carried away. It's not the way you're supposed to treat a brother. Especially one that I value so highly. Oh, I need a favor."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B., (Tooth whistles.) That was subtle.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Did you just whistle?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," I had to buy a candied apple when you denied me a banana. So, yes, I'm whistling. Satisfied?"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," It's not that noticeable. Listen, Dad would like for you to break into the permit office."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B., Dad? Dad said he wanted me for that?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," Yes, he did. Will you do it?"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B., Maybe. (Whistling.) I have some conditions. Terms.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Why?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B., One condition and one term. 
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, All right. Let's have a condition first.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B., A free banana whenever I want.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Single dip.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B., Double dip. But I'll take one stick.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," All right, what else?"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," Creative control, spin-off rights and theme park approval for Mr. Banana Grabber, Baby Banana Grabber, and any other Banana Grabber family character that might emanate there from."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, I retain animation rights and we go back to single dip.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B., Done. 
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Great. What else?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B., You humiliated me in front of my nephew. I expect you to fix that. I want the respect of your son.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," You better let me do the talking. George Michael, your uncle has a request."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," One Bluth banana, George Michael."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," Go ahead. Give it to him. G.O.B. deserves your respect, and from now on I want you to do whatever he asks you to do, okay? After all, he is your uncle, and, um... I think we ought to just embrace that."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B., Thank you.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," So, I held up my end of the deal?"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B., I can't believe I gave you animation rights. I hope that doesn't come back and bite me in the ass.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," Meanwhile, Lindsay, wanting to prove to Michael that she was a charitable person joined a group of activists dedicated to preserving the wetlands."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay," Yeah, hi. I'm gonna need a taxi."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay," I don't know if that smell is you, the car, something you ate, or something you're about to eat, but my God, you're in a service business. "
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Hello.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay," I'm in the wetlands. I've got a poker thing, and I'm gonna clean them up. So the next time you want to tell me that I'm uncharitable, why don't you just ask yourself, who called you from the wetlands?"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Who is this?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay," Nice try. You're the selfish one. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some nature to save."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," While Lindsay was finding it difficult to be truly charitable Michael was looking for an opportunity to rise to Lindsay's challenge, and that's when he recognized his mother's fill-in housekeeper at a bus stop."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," Hello there. You're not riding the bus today. Get in this car. I'm not taking no for an answer. Come on, don't make me get out of this car and put you in here myself."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," Unfortunately, the woman he picked up wasn't Lupe, but was a total stranger. And upon seeing bones, a shovel and what appeared to be blood... she realized he wasn't who she thought he was."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Helen Maria Delgado," Oh, mister, please, por favor, dejame salir del carro."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, This is going to be tricky. I don't speak Spanish.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Helen Maria Delgado, Yo es scared-o. Uh-huh.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Izquierdo. I know that one.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Helen Maria Delgado, Uh-huh.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," Left turn it is, missus. They call me selfish."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," He thought he was helping his mother's housekeeper, but he had the wrong woman."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," I mean, I guess it would just be a guy who you know, grabs bananas and runs. Or, um, a banana that grabs things. I don't know. Why would a banana grab another banana? I mean, those are the kind of questions I don't want to answer. "
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Hello?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay," Oh, Michael, it really... it's so beautiful here. You have to come down and see this."

1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay," Look, I screwed up, okay? I'm lost and I hate them. I hate the Wetlands. They're stupid and wet and there are bugs everywhere and I think I maced a crane, Michael. Look, you've got Dad's car, why don't you come pick me up?"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," Crazy. Loco. Listen, we got to make a little detour, okay? So I hope no one's waiting for you."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," In fact, the woman Michael thought was Lupe did have people waiting for her, and they had reported her missing. The real Lupe, meanwhile, was leaving Lucille's for the evening."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille 2, Buster... I'm... Oh. Hello. It appears my one-time admirer's not planning some grand romantic gesture after all. You know what? It's his loss. It's his loss. It's his loss.

1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," (Whistling.) No, I'm the substitute."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B., Right. Forgot about that.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Worker #3," Hey, Gary... get a picture of me with the new whistling delivery guy. "
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator, G.O.B. realized he needed a new plan.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," So, I need you to give your father a message for me."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,George Michael," All right, well, you heard my dad. I have to do whatever you ask me to."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," All right, take this lock-pick, break into the permit office for me."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,George Michael, I think I'd better check with my dad first.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Maeby, You're going to break into a permit office? Sweet. Can I come?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator, And George Michael saw a chance to get closer to Maeby.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,George Michael," You know, my dad hates to micromanage. Let's just do this."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," And back at the Wetlands, Lindsay finally found her taxi."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lindsay," Oh, good lord, you smell worse than before. Oh, my God, it's me."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," And in her haste to leave the Wetlands, she forgot to call Michael."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," Hey, hey. Stay there. What are you doing? Get in the car. Don't move. Lindsay! Linds! Come on, I'm tired of looking. She's not here. Probably never was here. She set me up. This is probably all about the car. I'm going to kill her. Hey! Where are you going? Hello? I'm trying to help you. You're welcome!"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," Meanwhile, G.O.B. met with his father to discuss the permit office break-in."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," (Tooth whistling.) So I say to Michael, ""If it's so important to Dad, I'll look past your selfishness and do it."""
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr.", There's a dentist in here who took liberties with his patients. And I'm going to ask him to take a look at whatever is happening with you.

1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr."," Hey, my stock is never going to be higher with his gang than it is right now."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," Yeah, so have you made a decision?"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr."," I don't know. I thought it had it down to two, but then the Haitians made this beautiful pitch."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr."," So, uh, any trouble at the permit office?"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," No, no, no, no, no."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr.", Easy.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,G.O.B.," No, I delegated just like you taught me."

1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Guard #1, No touching!
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,"George, Sr.", You stupid ass. 
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator, And George Michael was successful with the lockpick G.O.B. gave him.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,George Michael, What are you doing? We're supposed to put the form in the wrong file.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Maeby, I know. I'm just leaving my calling card.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,George Michael, I thought we didn't want anyone to know we were here.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Maeby," Well, it's a little late for that, our fingerprints are everywhere."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,George Michael, But you said they weren't gonna check for fingerprints.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Maeby," No, I said don't wear your mittens. I didn't want you to look stupid on the security cameras."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,George Michael, There's a security camera? Someone's coming. What do we do?
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Maeby, I don't know. I always get caught.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,George Michael," Save yourself. I'll take the hit. My record's clean. Well, I got my bike seat was stolen once, but I don't think it counts on your record if you're the victim. I mean, there is a record, but it's not like... "
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Maeby," Yeah, thanks. I'll take the rap next time we do something like this, okay?"
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,George Michael, Next time.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," And Lindsay made it to the Save the Wetlands auction, just barely in time."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Lucille," Oh, honey... You're not supposed to show up as the Wetlands."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," While Lucille was waiting for Buster to show up and bid on her, Buster was waiting for the other Lucille to leave for what he assumed was The Producers, but was now in fact, the bachelorette auction. And Lindsay was finally up for auction, which Michael arrived just in time to see."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,M.C.," What do I hear for Lindsay Bluth? Gentlemen, it's a good cause."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Narrator," And as Michael looked at his sister, uncertain whether her face was red from the embarrassment or the sun damage, it was clear she had been in the wetlands that day."

1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael," Well, you know, you actually went out there. I was impressed that you gave it a shot."
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Cop #1, Excuse me.
1,Charity Drive,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Charity_Drive,Michael, Yeah?

1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," It just doesn't make any sense, Dad. I mean, where'd this money come from and why did it end up in the international accounts file?"
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," George, Sr. was also anxious, but less about the bookkeeping."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr."," This game is never gonna happen. Look at this-half of these guys, they're still in their cuffs."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," I hate to be a buzz kill, but I'm trying to get you out of here."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr."," Yeah, well, I'm trying to get us out of last place, Michael. We're playing Rahway next week. Word has it that they're getting Jose Canseco."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, I'm starting to wonder why I even bother coming.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr.", That is ridiculous.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, You won't even talk to me.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr.", I'm catcher or I'm nothing.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," Frustrated by his father, Michael returned to work, where his assistant, Kitty, greeted him with some startling news."

1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Kitty," I said, ""Your wife is on line one."""
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator, But not immediately.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Kitty," Oh, oh, God, I'm sorry. George's wife. Your mother. "
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Kitty, I'm so used to being George's assistant.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," Kitty had been George, Sr.'s fiercely loyal assistant for years. And Michael suspected that she had the information he needed."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," Hey, Kitty. Listen, you wouldn't know if we had any documentation on those international accounts, would you?"
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Kitty, That's actually not any of your business... my business. That's not any of my business. 
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," (In phone.) Hey, Mom."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille, Are you aware that we have been downgraded to being just pool members at the club now?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," Yeah, it's a real shame what's going on with this family. You're stuck by the pool and Dad's getting picked last for softball."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille," Nonetheless, Michael, you can free up a little company money to get back our golf privileges."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," No, I can't, Mom. You don't even play golf."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille," No, but I use the clubhouse dining room until I was turned away today. It's embarrassing."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille," Take it back. If I wanted something your thumb touched, I'd eat the inside of your ear. "
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille," You should see the looks I'm getting. Fine, if you can't free up the cash, have your father call the club president."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," I've got news for you, Mom. I'm not visiting dad in jail anymore."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," No, I've had it. I really have. You know, I'm down there every single day. I'm trying to do what I can to get this company back on track and he barely even acknowledges me."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille, That is disgusting. Talk to your father. I will not stand for this.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," G.O.B., can I, uh... get you to stop doing that?"
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B., I'm just setting up an office. Got to write a strongly-worded letter to one Warden James Buck.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," In order to restore his career as an escape artist, G.O.B. had recently checked into prison as a publicity stunt."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Warden Buck, You think you can break out of my prison?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B., You won't even know I was here.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," But after a shiv to his side, G.O.B. was rushed to a local hospital, thus fulfilling, in G.O.B.'s mind, his contract with the public."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B., Ta-da!
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," And yet, the warden had refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the escape."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B.," I'm going after this guy with everything I've got. Art. Now, we are writing a letter."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Kitty, G.O.B.? I wish I would have known you were coming. I am a mess.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B., Don't know if a call from me would've changed that. 
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Kitty, (Snorting laugh.) Do you like my outfit?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B., Not as much as I like what's underneath it.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Kitty, G.O.B.!
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B.," No, I need your chair. Get up. I've got a letter to write."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Kitty," Whew, you're all business. Just like your dad."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B.," My God, she's repulsive."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator, Michael realized that Kitty's obvious attraction to G.O.B. could perhaps be of use to him.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, G.O.B.... how would you like a touch lamp?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," Meanwhile, Lindsay and Tobias prepared for their first session with a therapist."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lindsay," Yes, Tobias, I want the marriage to work. I just don't know if therapy is the answer."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Tobias," Oh, right. Because you didn't respect my old career and you certainly don't respect my new one."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lindsay, You don't have a new one.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator, Things have been tense since Tobias left his psychiatry practice to pursue an acting career.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lindsay," I have needs, you know."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Tobias, And how am I not addressing your needs?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lindsay, How can you even ask that? What is this?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Tobias," Oh, go right to that. Good, go right there. Real mature. Really great."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Tobias," Okay, kids. Mommy and Daddy are going out for ice cream."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Maeby, Can we come?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lindsay," Sorry, it's not for kids. "
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Maeby," Well, now we have to follow them."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael, Yeah. What? Okay... so why are we doing this?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Maeby," Cause it's obvious they're lying. Come on, drive!"
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael," Well, what if they see us?"
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Maeby, How are they going to see us?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael," Well, it says ""Bluth Company"" right on the side, plus it's a stairway. That's gonna catch the eye."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator, The airport stairway vehicle was the last vestige of the Bluths' former wealth.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," Also, that House Of Pies went out of business."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Maeby, You are scared. I knew it.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael," No, I'm not scared. It's just that... I have plans later. I'm visiting Pop-Pop."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Maeby, You visit Pop-Pop?

1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael," Hey, you know what you should do? You should go get your Mom's datebook. Yeah, she must have written down where they're going."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Maeby," Oh, hey, I still want to hear about prison, okay?"
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael, I hope you can handle it.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator, Michael arrived home in a good mood.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," With G.O.B. getting the information from Kitty, he would no longer have to visit prison and deal with his father."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," Hey, Buddy? I came home early. Wanna do something? Anything, anything at all."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael, I want to visit Pop-Pop in prison.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," Back at the office, G.O.B. was making progress with Michael's assistant."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Kitty, Here's where we keep all of our heavyweight paper.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B., I bet you can show me where a lot of things are.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Kitty, What kind of things are you looking for?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B., What... what are you hiding?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Kitty, Nothing you can't find.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B.," Wait a second... wait, wait, wait. Take off your glasses. Oh... wait, wait. Let down your hair. No, glasses on, hair back up. Let's just get that hair right back up. "
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Kitty, Let me turn the lights off.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B.," Yes, yes, please."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Kitty, How's that? Is that better?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B., It just seems like there's still light coming in from under the door.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," And Lindsay and Tobias were, for the first time, addressing their marital problems."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lindsay, It's like we're face-to-face now. Like we're really seeing this marriage and I'm afraid it's a lie.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Tobias," (Slow clapping.) Bravo. See, if I gave a performance that good, I'd have my own Alias-type show. "
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lindsay," Stop it. I am so sick of hearing about acting, acting, acting."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Dr. Gunty," Okay, okay, look-maybe we need a new approach. Um... let's try some role-playing."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Tobias, (Clapping.) Yes! All right!
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," Michael headed back to the prison, despite his earlier vow never to return."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael," You always say, ""family first."" I should see my grandpa, right?"
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," Listen, I'm not stopping you, but just after this, I'm not going back out there."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael, Why? Is it scary?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," Scary? No. No, it's the opposite of scary. It's like a carnival. Without the half person on the skateboard that grabbed your knee to steady himself. It's like a country club-all the guy does is eat ice cream and play softball all day. "
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," In fact, George, Sr.'s softball game had taken most of the day. It was the 14th inning and tensions were running a little high."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr."," I'll give you a thousand bucks if you call the next one a strike. My knees are killing me. Okay, no batter."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Umpire/Guard, Strike three.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Batter," Strike three, my ass."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr."," Oh... No batter, no. No batter. Shh..."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," Okay, there he is. Now, go on in there and surprise him. I'm going to get us a few ice cream sandwiches. Go on... go on."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael," Hey, Pop-Pop. How's prison?"
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr.", I'm gonna die in here.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael, What?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr.", They're gonna kill Grandpa. I gotta... I gotta get out of here. I'm an innocent man. You've got to help Pop-Pop get out of here. Give me your hair. Give me your hair! 
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Guard," Hey, no touching! No touching."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr.", Give me the hair.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," One of these got smushed, but don't let that ruin prison for you."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr.", (Softly.) No batter... no batter. No batter...
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator, I'm sure your grandfather was just kidding around. You know that's his sense of humor.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael," I know, I know. Yeah. I don't... I don't totally get the hair joke, but I'm fine, Dad."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, Are you sure?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael, Yeah.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," I am going to head back in though, okay? I'll see if Pop-Pop's got any more zingers. Why don't you just stay out here and relax, pal, okay? Watch the softball game."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael, Okay.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, I'll be right back.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Guard, Hey! Stop! Stop!
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael, Dad?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr.", I don't like prison anymore.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, That's why I'm trying to get you out of here.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr."," I don't know. Maybe I've been in denial, but this place is breaking me, Mikey. I'm alone here but for you."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," Come on. You got me, you got Mom."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr.", Your mother's never shown her face.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, Whoa! She's never been here? You should have heard the grief she gave me when I said I'd never show up again.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr.", You said... you said what?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," Dad, come on. You don't need me. You're playing softball all the time."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr."," I do need you, Michael. No more softball."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," This is nuts, you know? You're her husband. The least she can do is come out and visit you, right?"
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr."," God, you know your mom. This isn't her crowd. She's very easily threatened. You remember the carjacker?"
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," Well, she's certainly toughened up since then. You know, she's eating lunch by the pool now."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr."," Well, there's a big difference between the country club pool and the conjugal trailer."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, That's not what I meant when I said visiting.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr."," That's too bad, because I really miss that personal contact. It was the one thing that calmed me when I got stressed. It just felt humanizing."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," Michael, for the first time, saw his father as a vulnerable human being."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr."," Daddy horny, Michael. I haven't had sex in a month."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," You know, you've been here two months."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr.", It's hard to gauge time.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, Yeah. I'll bet. 
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, How long does it take you to get out there?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille," Oh, I've never been."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, Then why does he tell me that you've never been?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille," (Belching.) Ooh! Sorry, Michael. Pool food. My system's not used to curly fries."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," How can you ignore that man? You know, he's having a hard time in there. He's lonely."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille, That's what his children are for.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," Yeah? Well, you know, there are certain things that he can't get from his children."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille," If you're going to say pride, Michael, you're wrong. He is proud of his children. "
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," I wasn't going to say pride, Mom. Uh... listen. I... I... I think that... I think that you should... Oh, I can't believe I'm going to say this. I think that you should visit him in an intimate... marital... trailer."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille, Are you mad?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," You think I'm comfortable asking you to do this? I mean, he needs you, Mom."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille, Did he say that? Did he say that he misses me? Does he need his wife's embrace?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr."," Daddy horny, Michael."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, He said some wonderful things.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille," You really want this for him, don't you?"
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, I do.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille," Golf membership ""want it""?"
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," Meanwhile, Lindsay and Tobias were getting to the heart of each other's vulnerabilities with a role reversal exercise."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Tobias, Because I'm a woman...
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Dr. Gunty, Good.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Tobias, ...with a woman's needs..
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Dr. Gunty, Louder.

1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Dr. Gunty, Right.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Tobias," Please, Tobias. When was the last time you looked at these?"
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lindsay," Yeah, okay. How long is this session?"
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Tobias," Okay, well, see, I don't know what's happening here. She's breaking in and out of character."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lindsay, I don't want to be in a character.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Dr. Gunty," Okay, let me stop you guys, all right? Please, let me get in here."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lindsay, Thank you.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Dr. Gunty," You've never been a real wife to me, Lindsay."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Tobias," That's not true, and you know it! A man is looking back at you- a man with dreams and aspirations."

1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Tobias, ...I'm not even... Face it.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Dr. Gunty," I have dreams, Lindsay. Dreams... Lindsay."

1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, What's wrong with you?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B.," Oh, I'm sorry. It was just the thought of Mom and Dad together. I have a sense of propriety, all right?"
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, Fine. What's your great news?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B., I [bleep]ed Kitty.

1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B., I got the information.

1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B.," Oh, I see what you're getting at. No, I didn't get any information. "
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," That's great. Good, good, good, G.O.B.. Well, you just lost the touch lamp."

1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, No. The deal's off. Forget it. I'm going to use the touch lamp to set the mood in the conjugal trailer when Dad's nailing Mom. 
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B., No! Don't... Michael! You are filthy!

1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Maeby, I mean I care.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael, How could you not?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Maeby, You know our families are really messed up.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael, I know. We're like the only normal ones.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Maeby," At least we got each other, right?"
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Maeby, George Michael?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael," Sorry. Sometimes I just don't know if it's going to be a long hug or a short hug or like a middle or a medium hug. It's hard to tell sometimes. Yeah. It was, it was good. That's plenty for now. Okay, hug's gotta end sometime. Obviously. "

1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," Well, yeah, the drive was a little awkward."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr.", Not every son would do this for his father. I... Thank you for this.

1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr.", I've done a repulsive thing.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," Wait, whoa. It's Kitty? "

1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, Horny. I got that.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr."," Oh, come on. Hey, wait a minute. This is easy. This is the easy one. No, I-I'll go, I'll go in there with Kitty. I'll do, I'll do my thing and then, then I'll go and see your mother. This is a hard one."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, She's your secretary.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr."," See, you're right. Family first. Take care of Kitty. Michael. I need you now."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, International accounts need me?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," And so an agreement was made. George, Sr. would reveal the truth, and Michael would make sure Kitty didn't come out of the trailer."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B., Yeah?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," Hey, G.O.B., where are you? I need you to come to the prison."

1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille," I'm not going to have sex with you, George. I came to tell you how much I hate you for what you've done to this family. You've ruined us."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr."," I've ruined us? You got a lot of nerve, honey. The millions you pissed away on clothing and jewelry and the spa treatments..."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille," Yes, to keep you interested in the only thing you ever appreciated-my body."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,"George, Sr.", Can I help it if you got a fantastic body?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Lucille," And you're as powerful as a bear. My husband, the bear."

1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Kitty," Oh, G.O.B., this is so wrong."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,G.O.B.," And bright. Wrong... and, and bright. Much better. Brighter. God, you know what? I'm gonna, uh, I'm just gonna wash up real quick."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Kitty," I think I'm gonna go with, with down and off."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," G.O.B. had to do the right thing. But as he headed to his car, he ran into the warden, who had just read his strongly worded letter."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Warden Buck, Well. If it isn't Sincerely Yours.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator," And so, G.O.B. was detained against the window of the trailer his parents were becoming intimate in."

1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," Hey, buddy."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael, Where were you?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael, I had to help out your grandfather and then I had to vow that I would never help your grandfather again. Pretty much a normal day for me. How are you doing?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael," I'm fine, I guess. It's just... You know, you think of prison as this place full of guilty people and it doesn't bother you that much, but if Pop-Pop could be there, then anybody could be there, and I don't want to go to prison, Dad. I don't think I could take it. I mean, I know I act tough, but I..."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," Is this what you're worried about? 'Cause, you know, I got news. He's, uh... he's guilty."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,George Michael, He is?
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Michael," Oh, yeah. Incredibly guilty."
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Narrator, On the next Arrested Development... Tobias talks Lindsay into another session.
1,Visiting Ours,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Visiting_Ours,Dr. Gunty," And I decided that... I want to become an actor, too."

1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator, Michael Bluth had called a meeting with the family's long-time attorney to discuss his father's incarceration.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Barry, I am so sorry. It was a client. Okay...
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator, But he was finding it difficult to get any answers.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Barry, How long was I on the phone?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, 25 minutes.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Barry," Well, you know, with the cell phone charges, I could have rounded it out to about an hour, 'cause it's easier to bill. All right. Anything else to go over?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, We've got everything else to go over. We haven't done anything to get my dad out of jail.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Barry," Okay, first of all... What are you doing? Pilates? Because no 40-year-old woman should look like that."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," Well, no 40-year-old woman does look like that. "
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator," He was, however, getting along with his sister, which was unwelcome news to their mother who feared this unity might be used against her."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Barry," I do have some big news. It's going to cost you a little money- $20,000, something like that. The courts have agreed to let your father... out of prison."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, This is a lawyer.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Buster, He's a master.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Barry, For the entire afternoon.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," What-what do you mean, ""afternoon""? What afternoon?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Barry," The day before Christmas. In time for the Living Classics Pageant, because I know how important that is to all of you."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator, Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Buster, I don't really want to be Adam this year.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Barry," Well, if you want to play Eve, you got to get in line behind what, above five homos. That was wrong. I-I am so sorry. It's just that I have one down at the office now, and I mean it is every day. "
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tobias," I would be happy to play Adam. Uh, I'd prefer a speaking part..."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, Please don't speak for the rest of the meeting.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tobias, Zing!
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Buster," No, no, seriously, I don't want to play Adam."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille," Buster, every year we go through this song and dance, and every year you say, ""Thank you, Mama, for making me play Adam."" You're doing it."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator," This concerned Buster, as he'd been secretly dating his mother's best friend and chief social rival, Lucille Austero."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Buster, Can't we just stay here and play poker again? You can bet your vertigo medicine against my anxiety pills.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille 2," No! Buster, for God's sake, there's music to hear, places to go, envy to stir! Look, I'm tired of keeping our love a secret. We are going out, and that is that! Oh, Buster. Okay, I'm okay. I'm okay!"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Barry," Okay, I'm going to get out of your hair. We'll talk about this money later in the week."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," Excuse me, but we're not going to pay $20,000 to get my dad out for one day."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Barry," No, no, it's a bond. It's all refundable. Unlike my time."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," It's been a complete waste of two hours, okay? We're just not going to do it, and that's that. What do you doing? Are you writing two hours?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Barry," No, I'm taking notes. I'm taking notes on the case."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Let me see that. Let me just see that.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Barry, You're scaring me. You know what? Just leave it alone!
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Let me just see what you wrote.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Barry, Leave it alone! It is a gift from a client!
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, Barry's very good.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, He's an idiot.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Exactly.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, We're not trying to get Dad out for a night. We're trying to get him out for good. And we're going to get a new lawyer. I actually know of one who's available. His name's Wayne Jarvis. He's a top guy.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator," Wayne Jarvis had become famous after an employment discrimination suit against the family's current attorney, Barry Zuckerkorn."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,James Alan Spangler," It'll be a long time before Barry Zuckerkorn calls anyone a ""homo"" again."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille," You know, I am really happy that you two are in agreement, but we're not getting rid of Barry. He's like family, and you can't fire family."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," Yeah, I know. Hey, Maeby."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," Maeby, where have you been?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Maeby," You left me at home. You do remember you have a daughter, right?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tobias," Uh, yes, uh, of course we remember, and we were worried sick, young lady. She's fine. Our daughter is all right. "
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tobias, (Quietly.) Sorry. You said you didn't want her to come.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, I said I didn't want you to come.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tobias," Oh, that makes more sense."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, Now she's going to think we're totally self-involved.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tobias, I-I can fix this. Buster's probably still in the lobby. Let me go see if I can't get him to give me the part of Adam.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," Okay, and I'll see if I can get some money from my mom."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille," Lupe, there are some juice glasses on the sofa table."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," Oh, Mama, I'll help you clean up. (To Lupe.) There are some salad plates on the piano."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," Well, what a party. Mom, you make it seem so effortless."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, What do you need money for? A divorce? 
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," No, Mom. Tobias and I are doing fine, thank you. It's my credit card debt."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, Forget it.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, Fine. I'll ask Michael. He'll give it to me.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille," Well, maybe if you get him drunk. It's the only way he'll give money to someone who calls his ""stay-in-bed-mom..."""
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, He said that about me?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille," I know it was harsh, but, you know, he thinks you're completely irresponsible. A stay-in-bed mom. Probably because you don't work, and you're lazy. Oh... his words."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, I don't believe him.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, I know! Just when you were getting along so well.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Maeby, They've got to be kidding me.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator," Michael's brother, G.O.B., meanwhile, had missed the meeting that morning after being delayed by his girlfriend, Marta."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Marta, Te quiero.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,G.O.B.," English, please."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Marta, I love you.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,G.O.B., Great. Now I'm late. 
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator," And while G.O.B. took his girlfriend for granted, Michael was learning Spanish to get closer to her."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tape, That is not something I can bring to my boss.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator," Unfortunately, the one tape he could find was of little use to him."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tape, Are you going to the complimentary breakfast?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, That'll get her hot.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,G.O.B.," Well, if it isn't the boy who lives under the stairs."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," Hey, G.O.B."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,G.O.B., What are you doing? Learning Spanish?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," Nope. It's s... it's something for work, so, yes, uh, yeah..."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator," Meanwhile, Buster was trying to get George Michael to take his place as Adam."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,George Michael," I don't know, Uncle Buster."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Buster, But you don't have the frontispiece yet?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,George Michael, Frontispiece?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Buster," Look, I don't want to go through a whole song and dance with you. You're going to love it. Y-You just can't do anything that violates the original painting, like giggling or itching. They do allow some nervous crying, but you can tell they don't like it."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator, And Maeby was teaching her parents a lesson for forgetting her...
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Maeby, Who knows how long I'll be gone?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator, ...when she spotted George Michael.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Maeby, Nice pecs. Got a kickin' bod.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator, Thus George Michael found a compelling reason to keep the muscle suit on.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,James Alan Spangler, The law offices of Barry Zuckerkorn.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," Yeah, it's Michael Bluth for Barry."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Barry, (Whispering.) I'm not here.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,James Alan Spangler," Uh, Barry's not here. Can I give her a message?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Yeah. Tell her she needs to whisper a little softer next time. And I'm not paying for this phone call.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Barry," I am not a girl, you..."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,James Alan Spangler, Go on. Call me something. I'm redoing my kitchen.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, That's it! I've had it with this jerk Barry. I'm going to make Mom sit down with Wayne whether she likes it or not.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, You're the jerk.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Did I just wake you up? I didn't even know you were home.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," No, Michael, I don't just sleep all day."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator," Actually, Lindsay was so upset at Michael that she tried meditating to calm herself but ended up taking a two-hour angry nap. "
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Maeby," Yeah, this suitcase should be big enough."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Where is all this coming from? I thought we were getting along.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, Yeah. So did I. And now I hear you're telling our mother that I'm completely irresponsible and a stay-in-bed mom?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, That doesn't even sound like me. That sounds like Mom. Or Bruce Vilanch. Could be Bruce Vilanch.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," Yeah, well, then why would she say it?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Because we're getting along.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, 'Cause we're friends again.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," You gotta remember, Mom typically has nothing in her system except a bottle of vodka and an estrogen pill. "
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, Speaking of which...
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator, Michael and Lindsay proceeded to drink and air their grievances about their mother.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, She's always trying to get me to admit that my marriage isn't working.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," So, how's it going with you and Tobias?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," It's not working. And it's why I wanted her help with my credit card debt. I'm trying to take at least some of the pressure off this marriage. And if anything, it's worse, now we're sharing a bedroom."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, You guys were not sharing a bedroom before?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," Well, the cutoffs weren't exactly a turn-on."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," (Whispering.) Yeah, what's the deal with the cutoffs?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, You've got to promise not to tell anyone this.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Okay.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, He's a never-nude.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Is that exactly what it sounds like? 
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator," Tobias suffered a rare psychological affliction of never being able to be completely naked, even when alone."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tobias," Excuse me, do these effectively hide my thunder? "
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Doctor #1," Oh, I'm sorry. No, I need you to be completely undressed."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tobias, I am completely undressed.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, I thought he just liked cutoffs.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," Me, too."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," What about you? What-what's going on with your love life? I mean, have you even met anyone since your wife?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," That is the one subject I am not eager to talk about, Lindsay."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, I love Marta.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, Mom's housekeeper? 
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, G.O.B.'s girlfriend.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, Oh my God.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Yeah.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," Listen, you're a great guy, and if she doesn't see that, then someone else will."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," You know what else, Lindsay? You're great. And I'm going to move some money around. If it's going to help you get out of debt. You know, I'd be happy to do that."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," No, Michael..."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," Yeah! The hell with Mom, and here. Mom's never going to get between us again."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, Yeah.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator," The next day, Buster, having pawned off playing Adam, went to Lucille 2 to ask her out for Christmas Eve."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille 2, That is terrific! 'Cause I got two tickets to the pageant.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Buster, Mm! My-my mother's going to be there.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator, And George Michael was trying to pass as a more muscular boy than he actually was.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,George Michael,100
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Maeby, 100? I had you at ten.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,George Michael," I did some earlier in the day. It's a running total. So, wh-what's with the suitcase? "
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Maeby, It's a little test to get my parents to notice me. You ever get the feeling like no one even sees you?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,George Michael," I've got a really good body, so... no."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tobias," Hey, gang, whatcha doing?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Maeby, Just packing up. Packing it on up.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tobias," Uh-huh. Listen, uh, can I talk to you alone for a moment?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,George Michael," Oh, yeah, I'll-I'll leave you two alone here."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tobias," Oh, no, George Michael, I meant you. Maeby, can we have the room? So as you know, I was hoping to play Adam in this thing, and I want you to know that I am not threatened."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,George Michael, You know what? I'd be happy to let you play Adam if...
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tobias," Oh, give me the suit. Give me the suit."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,George Michael," I'm actually wearing it right now, but I can't tell you why."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tobias, You're wearing it right now?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,George Michael, I have to wear it all the time. You... you'd never understand.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tobias," Oh, please, I'll never un...? I'll never understand? That you can never be nude? I understand more than you'll... never know. "
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,George Michael, Yikes.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator," Michael finally arranged a meeting with attorney, Wayne Jarvis."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, We're looking for a more professional approach for our representation.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Wayne Jarvis," Well, I'm a professional. I am serious, and I'm a professional."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," That's fantastic. So, how long have you been...?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Wayne Jarvis, I also don't like small talk.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, No?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Wayne Jarvis, I find that unprofessional.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Mm-hmm.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Wayne Jarvis, Why should I be billing you for small talk when I'm enjoying it as much as you are?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," Then this must be a freebie, 'cause I'm having a ball."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Wayne Jarvis," (Chuckles.) When you're ready to get serious, give me a call."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," No, no. No, no. I-I'm sorry. I'm-I'm sorry. I'm serious. I'm ready."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Wayne Jarvis," Good. If you retain my services, I will get your father out of jail, and we will be countersuing before the end of the year. We're going to get this company's name back to where it started."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Or hopefully higher.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Wayne Jarvis, I didn't say that. Don't hold me to that.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," I won't, and I appreciate that to a wonderful degree. My mother is on her way up here, and-and she's, uh, resistant to the idea of hiring a new attorney. If she even sees you, she probably won't come in the room."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Wayne Jarvis, I shall duck behind the couch. 
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, What a pro.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, Michael.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Hi.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, I need to get the money to get your father out for the pageant.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," Actually that's not why I called you here today, and I'm not doing that. I gave that money to Lindsay to pay off her credit card debt."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille," Oh, what'd she do, get you drunk?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," No, we just, uh, well... we-we did drink a little bit. How'd you know that?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille," Because that's what she said she'd do. I said you wouldn't give her the money, and she said, ""He will if I get him drunk."" Probably because she thinks you're a cheap bastard. Oh... her words."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, She set me up?! All that stuff about her marital troubles and Tobias being a never-nude?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, A never-nude? I thought he just liked cutoffs.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, How do you treat somebody in your own family like that? Lying and deceiving and saying anything just to get your own way?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille," So, what did you want to see me about?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Hmm?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," Oh, um... there's a big bowl of candy in my office. Why don't you go eat it."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Wayne Jarvis," Wayne Jarvis, attorney at law. I have a responsibility to tell you that there is no candy in this office. "
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Lindsay.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, What are you doing here?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,G.O.B.," I had to get away from Marta. Ugh. If I have to smell another meal of fish, rice and mango, I'm going to kill somebody. And now Michael's learning Spanish. What's up with that?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille," Oh, who knows? He won't get your father out of jail for a night. He's bringing in a new attorney."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,G.O.B.," New attorney? And he's learning Spanish? He's hiding something, and I intend to find out what it is."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille," Do yourself a favor, get him drunk."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, Barry. (To Lucille.) I see you're getting closer to our attorney.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," Well, I just want you to know that I won't be needing your help after all. My brother, Michael, came through, as he always does, and as you never do."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, Whatever it takes to get your relationship with that never-nude back on track.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, Michael told you that?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, He couldn't wait to.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator," And later, while Michael was meeting with Wayne..."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," My thing with Tobias was a secret, like you stealing your brother's girlfriend, you little weasel. I mean, I open up to you, you run off and tell Mommy."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," Excuse me. Excuse me! Outside, please. Thank you. Pardon us. Like it wasn't just a bunch of lies to get me to pay that debt, huh? Isn't that why you got me drunk in the first place?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," Oh, yeah, I got you drunk."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Mom told me about your little plan.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, What plan? I had a great time last night!
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, So did I.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, Then why are we yelling at each other?!
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Mom.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, Unbelievable.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," She did it again. All right, we got to teach her a lesson."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, Mm.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," Excuse me, Wayne, my sister and I were outside having a business discussion, and we were wondering if there's some sort of legal way that we can humiliate our mother. Something shaming, something public."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Wayne Jarvis, I've used one adjective to describe myself. What is it?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Professional.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," Somehow, we got to screw Mom."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Maybe we can get Barry to help.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," Forget it. I think I was right about them all along. You know, Barry's taking Mom to the pageant?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, On a date?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, Yeah.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," You know, if Dad could see her on a date with Barry, he'd go crazy."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, Which would allow us to hire Wayne.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, How do you feel about staying in debt just a little bit longer?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator," So they decided to spend the money Michael had promised Lindsay to get their father out for the pageant, where he'd catch his wife on a date with Barry. Maeby, too, continued to try to teach her parents a lesson."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Maeby," Okay, so I printed the fake airline ticket from my computer. If my parents miss this, I really might go to South America."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,George Michael, That says Portugal.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Maeby, That's right. 
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator," Maeby's parents didn't find the ticket, but G.O.B. did..."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,G.O.B., Portugal?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator, ...which confirmed his suspicions.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,G.O.B.," Going to live it up down ol' South America way, huh, Mikey? "
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator, And Buster finally gave in to Lucille 2's wishes.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille 2, You ready to show me off before God and the whole world?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Buster," Well, it's not my Dad's reaction I'm worried about. "
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator," And George Michael finally saw the painting he was going to be recreating. And then what frontispiece meant. George, Sr. got his 24 hours of freedom as the pageant finally began."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Monti," You know, I saw you do this when I was kid. I was so impressed, you know. You were so still and god-like. You know, it was at that moment that I knew I would be a dancer."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,"George, Sr.", Glad I could make a difference.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator, Michael and Lindsay searched the crowd for their mother and Barry so they could revel in the public shaming they had engineered.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," Mom, what the hell are you doing?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator," But instead, they found her with Wayne."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, I don't have to answer that.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," I don't know which one of you I'm more disappointed in. No, it's Wayne. Wayne...!"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Wayne Jarvis, I have needs. I am a man!
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," Hey, watch..."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, What's the difference? Your father doesn't care about me. Barry tells me he's not even trying to get out of prison.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," Mom, he's here. Dad's here."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, He's here?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay," Yeah, he's here."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, Why did you do this?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, We were trying to teach you a lesson.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, You idiots. If he sees me with Wayne...
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, We'll be stuck with Barry.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Wayne Jarvis, I shall duck behind that little garbage car.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Guy's a pro. 
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Announcer," And now, ladies and gentlemen, Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator, And George Michael made his debut...
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," Hey, that's my... Yikes."
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator, ...breaking the pageant's cardinal rule.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Man in Audience #1, How dare he!
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Tobias," Oh, stop booing. There's nothing wrong with it. There are dozens of us. Dozens! "
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator, Buster arrived with Lucille Austero and naturally assumed the yells of disgust were directed toward him.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille 2," Buster, what is wrong with you?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Buster, What's wrong with you?! 
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille, Buster?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Buster," Oh, God. (Stammering.) I'm sorry, Lucille. (Moans.) Yeah, Lucille. Mom. I'm sorry!"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lucille 2," Man! That old lady has really done a number on you, hasn't she?"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Narrator, But George Michael wasn't the only problem with the painting.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Woman in Audience #1, Where is God?
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Woman in Audience #2, There is no God!
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Lindsay, (Scoffs.) There goes my credit card payment.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael, Dad?! Dad! D...! Dad!
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,"George, Sr.", Excuse me.
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,Michael," Dad! Hey, Dad, get back here!"
1,In God We Trust,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_In_God_We_Trust,"George, Sr."," No, I'm not going back!"

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lindsay," I know, Michael. That's why this is the perfect opportunity to throw her a surprise party. She'd never suspect it."

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael, Yeah.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Buster, Because I really like Mom.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael, We know.

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille 2, Yes. I'm foolish and I'm funny and I'm needy. Am I needy?
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Buster, No.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille 2, Are you sure I'm not needy? 'Cause I feel needy sometimes.

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Buster," We're probably not that different, you and me. You and I. Is it ""I"" or is it ""me""?"

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael, Surprise!
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Narrator," And once again, no one showed up."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille, I told you. They don't support me.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," Well, I hate to tell you, Mom, but they don't support me either. You know, I sat down and I told them this was important to me."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille, You did that for me?
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," I let you drive, didn't I?"
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille," Yes, you did, Michael. And I'm loving it. You're a good son. You always do things for others. You're the only one holding this family together."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," And you see a lot more than I give you credit for, Mom. You're not just concerned with yourself. You care about the family. Hey, is that G.O.B.?"
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille, It's an idiot on a scooter at night. It's got to be G.O.B. Let's give him a scare. 
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," Hmm? No, Mom, I don't think we should."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille," A nice little scare. What are you doing? Hey, big shot! Too busy to go to your mother's party?!"
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," Mom, that is not G.O.B. Mom! Mom!"

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," I... Yeah, I guess. How's my mom? She's so frail."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille, I'm fine. I'm fine. I was thrown clear. I only care about you.

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," Actually, my head does not hurt at all."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael, What did you give me?
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Dr. Miller, Your mother asked me to pump you full of...
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille, Children's aspirin.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Dr. Miller, Okay.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," You know, it's funny. I remember, um, leaving the restaurant, and then, uh, I was driving, I guess, but I just, I cannot picture it."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Dr. Miller," That's pretty common, actually. It's just short-term memory loss from the bump on the back of your head."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael, I can't believe I did this. My insurance rates are going to go through the roof.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille, That's not what matters now. Here. Get comfortable. Scoot up.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael, Scoot. Scooter- was there a scooter involved in...?
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille, (Gasping.) I can't believe I did that. I am so sorry. I'll get you some air.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," I hardly felt it. In fact, actually, uh, I didn't feel it. What was that?"
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille 2," Buster, do you remember when we were kissing last night?"
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Buster," It was a wild, wild ride. But is this something we can do? Is this something society will allow? "
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille 2," I don't care what other people think. My God, for the first time in years, I felt like I was standing on solid ground."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Buster," You know, my panic attacks have decreased. I feel confident. I'm feeling proud even."

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," You know, you really are more generous than I can remember. But that's what a parent does, huh? You put your kid first."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille," Rest up, sweetie. You gave me quite a scare."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," ""Scare."" Did somebody say, ""Let's give him a sc...?"""

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," Totally cool. Didn't feel a thing. You know, Mom, I'm crazy about this aspirin. Can't believe we give it to children. "

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",G.O.B.," No, are you kidding? So, what's up?"
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",George Michael," I, uh... need you to make some fake IDs for me and Maeby."

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",George Michael, I wouldn't worry about him. He's staying at Gangee's. He got in a car accident on the way back from the birthday party.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",G.O.B., I told him not to let her drive.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",George Michael," No, it was him driving. She's taking good care of him, too. She won't even let him use the phone."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",G.O.B.," So, you're telling me that he can't go anywhere, and he's incommunicado."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",George Michael, Yup.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Narrator, And that's when G.O.B. decided to take the yacht to South America for the summer.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",G.O.B., I've got to alert this boat's crew. They'll be devastated.

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Buster, Yeah.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Buster, I just jumped through a plate glass window on a date. (Laughing.) 
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," Oh. Well, women love to laugh."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Buster, It was worth it to be away from Mom's controlling grasp.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille," Buster, what's going on? What happened to your head?"
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Buster, Nothing. G.O.B. was just teaching me how to hit it with a hammer. 
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael, G.O.B. was there. G.O.B. was on his scooter... (Gasping.) I think I wanted to hit G.O.B.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille, Yes! That is exactly what happened. You wanted to give G.O.B. a scare. I don't know why.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," I think I do. Thanks, Mom."

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car","George, Sr.", I'm paying thousands of dollars in Krugerrands.

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car","George, Sr."," Gold Krugerrands. Your mother snuck them in here, stuffed them in energy bar wrappers to keep me from getting strangled in the shower or worse."

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car","George, Sr.", In a way.

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael, What was that?
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",G.O.B., I think that was on your end.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," The truth is, I can wait on selling the yacht. It's just money, right?"
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",G.O.B., Wow. How hard did you hit that steering wheel?
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael, I actually hit the back of my head.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",G.O.B., The back of your head?
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," Yeah. G.O.B., the accident only happened because I was trying to scare you. Maybe even hurt you."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",G.O.B., That doesn't sound like you. It sounds like Mom.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," Can we please just lay off Mom for a change? I mean, she's the one that helped me remember what happened, and trust me, I'm the bad guy here, not her, and definitely not you, so... would you please just take the yacht?"
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",G.O.B., I'll think about it. South America sounds good. But a chance to expose Mom... Turn this skiff around.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Captain #2, We haven't even left the dock.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",G.O.B.," But ""skiff"" is appropriate, right?"
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Narrator, G.O.B. rushed to shore to spare his brother from what he was certain were his mother's machinations.

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael, Coming. Ow! I got hit back there.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",G.O.B.," Right- on the back of the head, which means that you couldn't have hit the steering wheel. Mom must have clubbed you with a champagne bottle or something, so she could drive."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lindsay," G.O.B., how did you figure that out?"
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," No, no, he didn't figure anything out. I probably got hit on the back of the head because of Buster's rock."

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael, Mom can't pick me up. She could barely pick up that bag of protein bars.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lindsay," Guess what? They weren't protein bars. They were gold Krugerrands, and Dad finally paid attention to my intellect."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael," G.O.B., this is nuts. Mother is frail."

1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael, Stop lying. Stop manipulating. Just be nicer.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille, What...? All right. I'm a horrible mother.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lindsay," No, no, Ma, you're great."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael, That's crazy talk.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, George Michael and Maeby sneak back into Les cousins dangereux..."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Usher, Excuse me. You're too young to be holding that ticket.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",George Michael, Let's go. I can't go to jail.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Maeby, Let's just watch cartoons.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Usher," Sir, we will not be starting with Les cousins until you leave."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Lucille 2," Excuse me, but I thought my AARP card was good for one and a guest."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Buster," Hey, you know what? I knew that society would never accept this, and they never will."
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Narrator, ... and Michael's insurance takes another hit.
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",G.O.B., Ow!
1,"My Mother, the Car","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_My_Mother,_the_Car",Michael, I was definitely driving that time.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Narrator," Before going to work, Michael decided to have a little fun."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,George Michael, What are you doing?
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael, I'm doing a little cost projection analysis for a mini mall.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,George Michael," Wow, that's pretty cool you know how to do all that stuff."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Yeah, maybe your old man's just a little bit cooler than you thought he was, huh? (Grunts.) Ah, stupid, stupid chair. Very stupid chair. But it's also this stupid model home furniture. Maybe I ought to get myself one of those nice leather chairs from work."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,George Michael, People can take chairs home from work?
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Well, not everybody, but I'm the president of the Bluth Company since Dad's in jail and it's okay if I take a little something from work, you know?"
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,George Michael," Yeah, but isn't that why Grandpa's in jail, because he took things from work? "
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," You're a good kid, you know that?"
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,George Michael," I mean, a chair costs money so it's like stealing and you always say..."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Not stealing. Not. Okay, I'm the one that taught you that stealing is bad, all right? I'm just saying, you know, if I got a leather chair, okay, and I get to lean back... Oh, this one's gonna hurt."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lindsay," Leather chair? So, you're against stealing but skinning cows is cool with you?"
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," I'm fine, by the way. Frankly, your concern is getting embarrassing. Since when are you against leather?"
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Maeby," Yeah, you're not even a vegetarian."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lindsay, I'm not against the insides. People need meat to survive.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," You are aware that they don't remove it from the cow surgically, right? "
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Marta," Hi, Michael."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Marta. Hi. Hey. It's Marta. Hey, Marta, everybody. Great to see you."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Marta, I was just looking for G.O.B.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Well, you're his girlfriend."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Narrator," Michael wished Marta was his girlfriend, a secret he had only shared with Lindsay."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Marta," Actually, we had a big fight. He thought I was belittling his career, but I never would do that."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael, Neither would I. What career?
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Marta, The magic?
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Oh, the tricks, the little tricks. Those are great."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Marta," Well, he didn't like my reaction to his new one."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,G.O.B.," Real needle, real apple. Real neck."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Amable, He's a zombie!
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Marta, They're children! How could you do that?
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,G.O.B.," Oh, sure, first you dump all over it, now you want to know how it's done."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Marta, And I wanted to apologize.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Well, he hasn't been here."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Marta," But he said he was staying here. Oh, my God. Maybe he's staying with another woman."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," No, no, no. No, no, no. No, he is staying here. I just haven't seen him here... the foyer, or the kitchen."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Marta," Well, that's a relief."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael, Yeah.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Marta," Well, tell him to call me when he gets in."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," I sure will, Marta."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Marta, If you remember.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael, I will remember. Yeah. I'll give him the message though. Okay.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lindsay, She's gone.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael, Yep. Got it.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lindsay, You are too nice.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Oh, come on, what was I supposed to do, tell her that G.O.B. is not staying here? Tell her that G.O.B. is screwing around on her, God knows where he is? Actually, that-that sounded okay."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lindsay," Nah, you'll never be able to do it. You're too good. You're the-the noble one. The one who never wins."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael, I don't know about that.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lindsay, The loser.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael, Hmm?
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lindsay, The fool. 
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Maeby, She is such a hypocrite. Doesn't it drive you nuts?
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,George Michael," Crazy. Wait, who is? Which...?"
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Maeby, My mom. She pretends to care about all these causes.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Narrator, Lindsay had always been celebrated for her wine and cheese charity fund-raisers.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Maeby," I mean, now she's anti-leather? Let's see how she feels when her daughter's pro-leather. You want to go shopping with me? Bet you can get something cool."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Narrator," In fact, George Michael had been trying to prove to Maeby that he was macho after an embarrassing brush with her."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Maeby," Your legs look exactly like mine, and I just shaved mine."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,George Michael," So, I'm thinking of getting a motorcycle."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,George Michael," Yeah, I'm gonna need a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and need to go into a controlled slide. "
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Tobias, There's my little girl. I've got great news. Daddy has the entire day off.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Maeby, But you have every day off- you don't have a job.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Tobias," Well, I don't need money to hang out with my daughter. Where are you going?"
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Maeby, We're going shopping.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Tobias," Oh, no, no, I can't do that. "
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Narrator," The next day, Michael was stopped on his way to work."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Rollo, Get in.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael, What?
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Rollo," If you care about your brother, you'll get in this car."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael, Which brother?
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Rollo, G.O.B. Let me be clear. Tell him Rollo wants him to say good-bye to his legs.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Narrator, Michael went looking for G.O.B.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lucille, I'm so glad you're here. I want you to help me break up your brother and his girlfriend.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Well, I'm all for that, we just got to find him first."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lucille, He's locked on the balcony.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Oh, you meant Buster. I thought you were talking about G.O.B."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lucille," No, I will not have Buster dating my best friend."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Narrator," Tension had been high between the two Lucilles since Buster had announced he'd been dating her. Although neither had addressed this, both had given indications of their true feelings."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Buster," Mom, you're ruining our fort!"
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lucille," I mean, she's been a family friend for years. It's just... creepy."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Hey, buddy."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Buster, Hey.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Mom, I think you might be overreacting."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lucille, She changed him as a baby.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Okay, that's about the creepiest thing I've ever heard."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Buster, That's why she didn't look surprised. 
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lucille," You're the only child who chose a spouse I liked, and she's the one who had to die."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael, I know. That's rough for you. 
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Mom, I'm looking for G.O.B. There's some people after him and I don't know whether it's gambling or what, but, um, they want to break his legs."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lucille," It's good thing he's already got that little scooter. (Laughing.) Oh, don't give me that look. I happen to be a more caring mother than most."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Buster, Where's my bed?
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lucille, I put it in storage. I guess you'll just have to decide which Lucille you want to spend your nights with.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Okay, before I leave this place for the last time ever, has anyone seen G.O.B.?"
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Buster," I saw him last night at the Playtime Pizza Theater, on my date. Of which I have another one tonight, and I'm going to continue dating, Mom."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Sound a little bit like, ""dating Mom."""
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Buster, It's starting to feel a little like it.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael, Mm.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Narrator," Lucille decided she needed the help of Buster's father. Unfortunately, after a recent escape attempt, George Sr. had been put in solitary confinement."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Narrator, Michael went to find his brother at his latest gig.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,G.O.B.," What's up, Mike?"
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Yeah, what are you doing here?"
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,G.O.B.," Can't get any work, Mike. Magicians' Alliance has blackballed me from every venue in town."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael, Hmm.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,G.O.B., Even my own so-called girlfriend doesn't believe in me.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Well, I don't want to get into that part of your life anymore. Okay, listen, I just came here to tell you that this guy named Rollo pulled me over and made some threats."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,G.O.B., What kind of threats?
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael, He said to say good-bye to your legs.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," I don't know whether this guy's a mobster, a loan shark, something equally scary."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,G.O.B., Magician.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," I think you're confusing ""scary"" with ""silly."" This guy was frightening. He was in a limo."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,G.O.B., He replaced me in the Alliance. He's the reason I've got to do my act in this hellhole.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael, Then why does he want to break your legs?
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,G.O.B., He doesn't want to break my legs. He wants to take my legs.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael, I-I don't...
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,G.O.B.," The legs. You know, the bottom half of my ""Saw the Lady in Half"" trick. No, not now! I'm showing him how to do the trick! Two chicks curl up in a box. We call one the head, one the legs."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Kid #1, So that's how they do it.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,G.O.B.," Oh, God, I've got to stop giving these things away. "
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," The top half, though, what do you do about that?"
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,G.O.B., I just get a volunteer from the crowd.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Oh, yeah?"
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,G.O.B., The old top half quit when she found out I was sleeping with the legs. Word really gets around in there.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," So, Rollo wants your legs, but you're cheating on Marta with those legs. Is that about right?"
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,G.O.B.," Would you give me a break, please. The legs are insanely jealous."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Is that why you haven't seen Marta for the past few days? This is all about your love life again, isn't it? I can't believe. Just forget it. I came here to try to help you..."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,G.O.B.," Hey, I appreciate your time. "
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Great. Great. You know what, G.O.B., Marta is a once-in-a-lifetime woman. She's a treasure, and I don't think you're showing her enough respect, okay?"
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,G.O.B.," Hey, she doesn't respect my career."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lindsay, He's having sex with a woman in his act?
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael, I've got to tell Marta what's going on.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lindsay," First of all, she'll hate you for it. It's called ""shoot the messenger."" Secondly, it's not in your nature. I mean, you're like, Mr. Morals. You can't even take a desk chair."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Damn it. You know, I'm a saint, you know. I'm a living saint and I get absolutely nothing out of it."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lindsay," Well, you get a false feeling of superiority."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Yeah, no, that is nice, but this time, it's not enough. Why do I always have to be the one that has to set the good example for everyone? "
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,George Michael, Guys?
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Michael," Oh, that's why."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Maeby," Hey, Mom."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lindsay," Hey, honey."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Maeby, Moo.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Lindsay," Mm, moo, honey."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Tobias, You have to be some sort of she hulk to get this. 
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,George Michael, You've just got to really dig.
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Tobias," Well, it's not... enjoy..."
1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Tobias," Oh, Maeby, great news. I got my hands on some money. I can't say how or when... or where my wedding ring is, but my purse overfloweth, as do my high spirits, so a shopping we must go."

1,Storming the Castle,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Storming_the_Castle,Marta, And a once-in-a-lifetime woman.

1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay," Oh, grades are meaningless. Maeby's last school didn't even have them."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator," Back in Boston, Maeby's parents had enrolled her in a progressive school with its own system of evaluation."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," All I'm saying, Lindsay, is that you know, you might want to push her a little bit because a kid without discipline can get into some pretty tough stuff."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay, So you think she's going to suddenly turn to drugs because she got a C plus?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Minus. And yes, I think that without boundaries, a kid can get into trouble, and yeah, sometimes that can mean drugs."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay," Well, I think stress is what leads to trouble. You know the kind you put on George Michael, even when he gets an A?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Minus. And an A gets him ice cream. He knows that.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay," See, you're as bad as Dad with his ridiculous lessons."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator," George, Sr. had used his considerable means to stage intricate scenarios, to teach his children what he considered valuable life lessons."

1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,J. Walter Weatherman, I'll get my gear.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator," Typically, these scenarios would involve a man named J. Walter Weatherman, a one-time employee who lost his arm in a Bluth Company construction accident."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Young G.O.B., Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr.", We're out of milk. I could have got it earlier if someone would have left a note.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr.", Oh.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr."," Why?! If someone had left a note, this innocent man would still have his arm! Why?!"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,J. Walter Weatherman, And that's why you always leave a note.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Well, those lessons worked, didn't they? I mean, we still leave notes to this day."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay," Oh, that's what that was about. I thought he was trying to get us off of dairy."

1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," What happened to ""Hello. I need a favor""?"

1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Hot Cops?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., It's the stripping agency I used to work for. Cop uniform?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Right.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B.," You know, I might've been a little too believable."

1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., My gut is telling me no. But my gut is also very hungry.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., All right. I'll do it.

1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lucille, Not after we doctor all these receipts.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," I can't help you, Mom. I've got a job. I've got to make some money so you can buy more things and destroy the evidence."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lucille, You're right. I'll ask Lindsay.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Hey, Buster."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster," Hey, brother."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, You headed over to your girlfriend's?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster, Yeah. She's down again.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator," Buster's girlfriend Lucille Austero, suffers from chronic vertigo, which she has been trying to fight without the use of medication."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster, And her nausea's gotten really bad too. It's really been difficult on us. It's definitely taking its toll.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Well, you know, you're free to go, pal. It's not like you made a commitment to this woman."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster," Well, I didn't make a commitment... I did refer to it as our nausea. But you know, that's when we were going at it really hot and heavy."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Well, now it's my nausea."

1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay, I can't.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lucille, Why not?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay, Because I'm... Don't want to.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay," Well, maybe I don't feel like being criticized around the clock."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lucille," I don't criticize you. And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense."

1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay, This is a D minus.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Maeby," Well, either way, it's above a D right?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lucille, Another worldbeater.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator, And Lindsay realized she needed to take a firmer hand with her daughter.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay, I'm not signing this.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Maeby," Fine, I will. Is Lindsay with an ""A"" or an ""E""?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay," Okay, look. I know you got a crocodile in spelling, but this has gone too far."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay," I hate to say it, but Michael might be right. You need to learn a little discipline."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Maeby, Hmm. Nope. That doesn't feel right.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay," No, no, no. I am telling you."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay, You are now punished. I punish thee.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Maeby, Are you serious? What could you possibly come up with that would punish me?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay," Oh, I have to come up with another thing?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lucille," Oh, Lindsay? Before I go, I just have one word for you. Sleeves."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay, You're going to spend the day working for your grandmother.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael," No. No, that's not the answer. What? No. You stupid jerk. Why don't you... Dumb. Dumb. George Michael. Dumb. Dumb."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Whoa! Whoa! Calm down, you two. It's just a math problem."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael," Yeah. But if I fail math, there goes my chance at a good job and a happy life full of hard work, like you always say."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Maybe I'm pushing you too hard. You're all stressed out. Your eyes are all red. Why don't you take the night off. Just shut the book. Go ahead. Just close the book. Go ahead.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Your finger is still in the book. George Michael.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator," Buster, meanwhile, was still worried about Lucille 2, whose condition seemed to be worsening."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster, You okay? How is your nausea?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lucille 2, Our. 
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster," I mean, our, our nausea."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator, He remembered a study he took part in on medical marijuana and its effects on nausea.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator," The subjects took the drug in the form of a THC pill. Nausea was then induced with a day at the carnival, which is what attracted Buster to the experiment in the first place. Buster was found two days later trying to eat his way through this enormous plaster donut."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator," So Buster went to the toughest, most streetwise kid he knew."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, Enjoy. Tell your friends.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster," Hey, nephew. I was looking for you at your home."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael," Oh, yeah. Dad told me to take the day off so I decided to come in to work."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster," Oh! So I thought maybe you could help me get some weed. It's not for me. It's for Lucille 2, my girlfriend."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, She's your girlfriend? Dad said you were her nurse.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster," Look, she's sick. This could help her."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster, Pill form would actually be fantastic because I could put it on a little tea biscuit and I could just tell her it's a marshmallow.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael," Look. I have no idea where to get something like that, okay? What makes you think I would?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster," Well, you work here. This place is pot central, right?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator," In the '70s, the Boardwalk was the place to buy marijuana in Newport Beach. The stand served as a convenient meeting place because of the banana's resemblance to a yellow marijuana cigarette. It had even inspired a song."

1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael," Look, I'm sorry. I can't help you, okay? Why don't you just ask Uncle G.O.B.?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Young G.O.B., Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster," No. No. He'd never do it. Besides, he always makes fun of me for dating Lucille. Everybody does."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, That's horrible.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, I'm working.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster, You can't tell anybody.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, George Michael!
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, Oh. Hey!
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, What are you doing here? I thought I told you to take the day off.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael," Yeah. But there's nothing to do. I mean, Maeby's at Gangee's..."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Find something to do. Go make mistakes. Get in trouble. Be young.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster, Yes. I totally agree. Make a mistake.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Now here. Here's 20 bucks. I want you to close up shop and go crazy. Go find yourself something to buy that you don't need.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster, Absolutely. Here. Take $225 from me.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator," Maeby, meanwhile, was working with her grandmother."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lucille," And this is from when your Pop-Pop yelled out ""Oh, Melanie!"" when he was making love to Gangee."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Maeby, This is so much fun. I can't believe my mom thought being here would be a punishment.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lucille," Oh, she thinks I'm too critical. That's another fault of hers."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lucille," Ah, yes. The week we had the au pair. You know, your mother always wanted this brooch."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Maeby, Really?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lucille, Do you want it?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Maeby, I do now. That'll show her for trying to punish me.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lucille," Oh, pretty. It'll distract from the freckles."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator, George Michael nervously approached the family yacht G.O.B. had been staying on.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, Uncle G.O.B.?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator," When he saw the yacht was empty, George Michael, as he'd been trained to do since childhood, left a note for his uncle. Back at the model home, G.O.B. showed Michael the note he'd found at the dock."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Oh, no. This can't be from my son."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B.," Well, it is his handwriting. Plus he left me $200. $100. 100- I accidentally said 200."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, This is impossible. Why would he do this?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B.," I know. You know? I was shocked. I mean, really, $100. You can't get good weed for a hundred bucks. Anyway. Here you go. Now we are even on you paying off that Hot Cops thing. Might just be a few stems... but it should be pretty good."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Get that the hell out of this house! What's the matter with you?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., Maybe you should save the lectures for your son. If he can remember them.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Man, I speak to Lindsay one time about her stupid hippie parenting and I end up with a hippie."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., Yeah. It does seem pretty quick.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," For all I know, this has been going on forever. You know, he's been stressed. His eyes have been red. His grades are dropping."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., I heard about the A minus.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," All right, I'm going to go find out what's going on."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, Hey.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Hey, what are you doing?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, Nothing.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," No? So, uh, listen."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Your Uncle G.O.B. seems to think that he saw you down at the docks today. Was that you?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael," No. No. Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Yeah, that makes sense."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, Yeah.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," What did you do with the, uh... the money that Buster and I gave you to go have fun with?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, I put that in my savings account.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Is that right?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, Yeah. Save up.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Okay. Thanks for being honest. (To G.O.B.) He's lying to me. Can you believe that? Where the hell is this family's morality?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., I don't know.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, What?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., It's cold out here.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," So what do I do now? If I confront him, he's just going to lie to me again. Should I yell at him?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., Didn't Dad teach us that we don't yell in this family?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Young G.O.B.," Why ain't you getting up, Buster?!"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,J. Walter Weatherman, Tell me before you hit the gas!
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr.", I can't hear you! The kids are yelling.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,J. Walter Weatherman, Tell me before you hit the gas!

1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,J. Walter Weatherman," No, wait! No. No! Ah! Ah! My arm! Ah!"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,J. Walter Weatherman, That's why you don't yell.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Yeah, yelling is not a good way to go. I got a better idea."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr.", You want to teach George Michael a lesson?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Yes, I do. And it's got to stick. He's getting into drugs, Dad, and he's lying to me."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr.", That doesn't sound like the boy.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," I know it. I know it, but it's my fault. I've been pushing him too hard. It's just dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Michael. Dumb."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr."," Hey, hey. Shh. I forgive you."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr."," Uh, he's, uh, dead. You killed him when you left the door open with the air conditioner running."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," For God's sakes, Dad. He's not dead. Listen, I need to do this soon. Down by the docks, I'm going to make it look like a drug deal went bad or something."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr."," Tonight? No, it's Yontif, the first night of Yom Kippur."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Dad, that's just one night, and it's back in September. That's okay. You've only been a Jew for about two days."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr.", Just try to talk to him.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Like you talked to me when I was growing up?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr.", I thought you hated those lessons.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," I did, but they worked, and they will work again."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr."," Well, I'm done with them. Because it was wrong, Michael."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Come on.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr."," Your son is a timid, thoughtful boy. He's a scholar like his grandfather."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr."," What time is it? Oh, almost sundown. I have to prepare for the Sabbath."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, It's Tuesday.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr.", Shh.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator, Lindsay went to see how her own attempt at parental discipline was coming along.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay," So, having fun? Where'd you get that brooch?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Maeby," Gangee. Nice, huh?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay, That was supposed to be for me. She was my au pair. I'm the one who cleared my throat and pointed to the laundry room. Ma! You know I wanted that.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lucille, I know. But it's an elephant. And I didn't want to invite the comparison.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay, Nice.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay," In any event, your punishment is over. Come on, Maeby. Let's go."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lucille," She's not going anywhere. We're having fun. Here, Maeby, try this on."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay," I see. Fine. I was going to take her out for ice cream, but if you'd rather stay here. Well, that's just fine with me."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Maeby," Well, we can go get some ice cream, Gangee. That would be fun, right?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lucille, I don't think so. That chubby little wrist of yours is testing the tensile strength of this bracelet as it is.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator, Maeby decided that perhaps she'd had enough of her grandmother.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lucille, Maeby. Maeby?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Hey, G.O.B. It's Michael. Listen, I figured out a way for you to repay that favor. Dad wouldn't help me teach George Michael the lesson, so I need your help and your Hot Cop friends. I want to fake a drug bust."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B.," Michael, these guys are real dancers. You know, they've never done any ""hot"" policing."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Well, they don't even need to be hot. They just need to show up in those uniforms."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator, And so Michael's plan was put into motion.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster," Where have you been? I am like a caged animal. My old lady's on the floor, man. I am not essing around."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, Yeah. G.O.B. just called. He's got the stuff at the yacht.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster, Great. Let's go.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, No. No. I think my dad's on to this. I'm out. I'm not...
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster, Whoa! Whoa! Come on. G.O.B. will never give it to me. My woman is sick. Please.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator," Later that night, Michael made the final arrangements with G.O.B."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," All right, G.O.B., is this gonna be believable? I want him scared. I love this kid."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B.," These guys are pros, Michael. They're gonna push the tension till the last possible moment before they strip."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," They're not going to strip, are they?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B.," I told them not to, but I can't promise that their instincts won't kick in."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B.," Anyway, trust me, it's gonna be totally real, all right? This kind of thing goes on all the time out here. Boats wait offshore, lights are flashed, a guy comes over and drops off a bag. It's gonna freak the little bastard out."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator," Michael went off to hide, while nearby, Buster and George Michael arrived as planned."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster, I really appreciate you doing this for me. You're making a very miserable person happy.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael," She really feels awful, huh?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster," Oh, I was talking about me. But yeah, she's a mess. Be careful."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, Uncle G.O.B.?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B.," George Michael. You weren't followed, were you?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael," No, I don't think so."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B.," All right, kid... let's deal some drugs."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, What are you doing?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., Flashing the lights. So the dealer knows what's going down. Now we wait.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, How long?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., Who knows? An hour... maybe five.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Derek, Drug delivery. You wanted some marijuana?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B.," No, uh, not me- my nephew did."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Derek, Show me the money.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., Show us the pot.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Derek, I got it right here.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael," Oh, my God."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Derek," Nice, right?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B.," Okay, you can put your shirt down, Derek. Just give him the stuff. (Loudly.) So... we have a deal."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Derek, (Loudly.) We have a deal.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Marcus, He's ruining his life!
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Hot Cop #2, Freeze! Police officers! Freeze!
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B.," What? Oh, no! It's the cops! Oh! And a construction worker."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Hot Cop #3, Let's get this party started.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., Aren't you guys gonna cuff him?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Hot Cop #3, You wanted handcuffs?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," All right, George Michael... hope you learned your lesson, pal."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,All, Yeah! Yeah!
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Okay, all right, thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, What is this?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," This is a lesson, and maybe I pushed you into this, but... I love you too much to see you ruin your life with that crap."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, But it wasn't for me.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Then who was it for? Who? Give me a name.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael," Okay, it was for me. Yeah. I was gonna smoke the marijuana like a cigarette."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Well, now you're looking at a nice, big, fat punishment."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster, I'm sorry. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Ooh!
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, What are you doing here?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster," The, uh... the boy was looking out for me."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., What?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster, It-it's for my girlfriend. She's sick.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., Why don't you just wait it out? She's gonna be gone soon.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster," Oh, that's it. Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Hey! Hey! Hey!
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Buster, Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, What's the matter with you? Easy. Is that true? Why didn't you tell me this?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael," Well, you're always telling me to do the right thing. Family first."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," You know, it is unbelievable that you'd ask my son to score you pot. Why don't you drive him home, and you and I will talk about this later. Go ahead. Go with Buster."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, I'm sorry.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Hey. What are you guys doing?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Drug Dealer, We got your signal. You flashed the lights. We got the drugs. You got the money?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. We're all good."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Drug Dealer, We just want the money. You want to make this ugly?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B.," We were just teaching the young fellow a lesson. We don't want any trouble with you, governor. Thanks very much."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Drug Dealer, You know who you're dealing with?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Police, (Over loudspeaker.) Drop the boxes!
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Police, Put your hands in the air.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Drug Dealer, What is this?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., We had nothing to do with this!
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Drug Dealer, You set us up!
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,G.O.B., No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are!
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, Everybody take a breath!
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,J. Walter Weatherman," Oh my God, my arm!"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Oh, my God, this guy's arm! Just... came off and landed on the dock."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator," Michael realized that his father had, once again, taught him an elaborate lesson."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,J. Walter Weatherman, And that's why you don't teach lessons to your son.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, How could you do that to me?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr."," I told you, he's a good kid. You should try talking to him when you think he's in trouble. Don't make the same mistake I did, you know, teaching lessons."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael, So you taught me a lesson not to teach lessons?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,"George, Sr.", (Sighs.) It was my last lesson.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Narrator, Back at the model home...
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay, Back from your wonderful time with Gangee?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Maeby," Well, actually, it wasn't so wonderful. She could be kind of nasty. But I'll tell you something. I'm glad you're my mom. Oh, um, I got you something."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay, You're giving me this?
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Maeby, You deserve it. I can't believe you have to put up with her your whole life.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Lindsay," Honey... Oh, this is so sweet. Let's sell it and go shopping."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," You knew the whole time, didn't you?"
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael, Kind of. One of the Hot Cops is my choir teacher.
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Buddy, I'm sorry about all this. It's just, you know, you were so stressed out, and I guess I got scared. I should probably learn to talk with you a little bit more."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael," Well, I think we're okay."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," We are. I mean, you know that there's nothing that you can't be totally honest with me about. I mean, you could say anything to me, you know? Anything at all."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,George Michael," Like, say I had a crush on my own cousin."
1,Pier Pressure,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Pier_Pressure,Michael," Hey. (Laughs.) You just taught me a lesson. All right, we're even."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator," Michael Bluth was taking his son to an interview at the prestigious Milford School, an institution once famous for its credo that children should be neither seen nor heard."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Child at Milford School, Woman.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, (Whispers.) They're not getting in.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael," But, Dad, you know, I might not get in, either, and that wouldn't be the end of the world."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," We're not even going down that road, okay. The next four years are all about your future, and that's the most important thing to me, okay?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Charles Milford, Things have changed around here. We have talking sessions throughout the day. We even have a talking room where students are encouraged to go in and talk to their heart's content.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael, Sounds like fun.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, First thing he's said all day.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Charles Milford," The point is, I am not my father, but I do think it's best for the Milford School to... distance itself from the Bluth name. It's... it's nothing personal."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Are you talking about the fact that my father is in jail? Because I don't like to be compared to my father, either."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael, I don't mind being compared to my father.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Save it for the talk room, son."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael, Sorry.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, I can assure you that my family is back on track and no longer in any trouble.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Charles Milford, Not according to today's paper.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Oh, God, what have we done this time?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille, Don't ever mention Klimpy's to me again.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, What did you do?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille," If I still had money, I'd buy a Klimpy's just to burn it to the ground."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," I know, Mom. You hate Klimpy's. Tell me what happened."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille," Well, your sister and I tried to get into that new restaurant, Rud, and they wouldn't let us in."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Hostess," Mrs. Bluth, there's absolutely no room."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay, Come on. I've suddenly lost my appetite.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille," Oh, who's going to believe that?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator," With her blood sugar at a perilous low, Lucille made Lindsay pull into the nearest restaurant."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Loretta, Welcome to Klimpy's. Anywhere you like.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille, This does not bode well.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille, I'll have the Ike and Tina tuna.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Loretta, Plate or platter?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille," I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Loretta, And what would you like?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay, I'd like my old life back.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, So there really was no fight.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille," Well, one tiny thing at the end."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay, (Sobbing.) How can you treat me this way?!
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille," Oh, please! Everything I've said about you can be covered with makeup and a lie about a thyroid problem. Good grief almighty! You think I'm enjoying my slide into poverty?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille," Sorry, Lindsay. There goes your dessert."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay," Why don't you eat it, Mother! Why don't you just take this cake and shove it... Hey, who called the cops?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille, It was all just a big misunderstanding.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay, Totally blown out of proportion.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Well, listen, just so you know, I think it cost George Michael a chance to go to the Milford School."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille," Oh, big deal. Buster's the only one who ever liked it."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator," Buster so excelled at being neither seen nor heard that he remained at the school, undetected, for a full two semesters after he was supposed to graduate."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Nonetheless, Mother, I think this bad press is starting to taint my son's future, and we've got to put an end to it."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay," Michael, if this is a lecture on how we're all supposed to whatever, and blah, blah, blah, well, you can save it, 'cause we all know it by heart."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lupe," Good-bye, missus."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Well, then, Lindsay, you'll be happy to know that I have a new idea."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, I met a publicist today. I'm going to hire her. We need somebody to make us look good.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille, And I say it's a waste of money. We're-we're plenty sympathetic as we are. Is this your onion?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lupe, Yes.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille, What's in the foil?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lupe, Nothing. It's a ball of foil for my son.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille," Have a great day, sweetie."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, I don't know how she can't.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay," So, this publicist, Michael, is she cute?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, I never really noticed.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator," In fact, Michael had noticed her at the gym, but only recently gotten up the nerve to talk to her, giving him a chance to work on his flirting skills..."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie, Race you to the top of the hill.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator, ...which had gotten rusty over the years.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, I'll race you to the top of the hill.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie, I brought a picnic lunch.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, Hey. That hill was...
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie, Jessie Bowers - if you ever have any public relations needs.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, My relations are already a little too public - I'm Michael Bluth.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie, From the Bluth Company?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, That's right.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie," (Laughs.) Oh, I'm giving you my direct line."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Okay, sure, she's, uh, she's cute. I suppose. I mean, now that you're making me think about it. Uh, she's cute. She's a cutie. She's a little cutie pie. But I never really noticed."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay, Why don't you just ask her out?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, That's not an option.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay, Because you're scared?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," No, because of George Michael. He still hasn't gotten over losing his mother. I just want to get him through high school, and then we'll deal with me, okay?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay," So you didn't get any while you were in high school, and now you're not gonna get any while George Michael's in high school."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator," And so the family gathered at the model home, eager to hear their new publicist's plan."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B., Get jobs and behave?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay," Instead of us getting jobs, why don't you do your job and tell everyone we've got jobs?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael," You know, I have a job."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Tobias," (Fake cough.) Kiss-ass. Well, we were all thinking it."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Buster," Uh, I'm unclear about what it is exactly you do."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie, Excellent question. What a publicist does...
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Buster," No, no, I was talking to George Michael. When did you get a job?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael, At the banana stand.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Buster," (Laughs.) Oh, duh. I thought you meant, like, a plumber or something, and I was, like, when did that happen?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Jessie, why don't you just go ahead and jump in here. It's a tough group to keep focused."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie," Well, I'm going to go on the offensive. I want to get an article in the paper to show that this is a functional family and this is a relatable family."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,"George, Sr."," Are we on? Hello. Hello from prison. Thanks to Jessie for setting up this tele-link. I started a, uh, Torah study group. Very excited about it. It looks like, I don't know, it looks like some, uh... I have some possible converts."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie, Your father's religious now? We'll play that up. It's very sympathetic.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille, Yeah. Who doesn't love the Jews?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie, And it allows me to put Michael front and center. He needs to be the new face of this family. He is the only likable one in the bunch. No offense.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, None taken.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B.," (Laughs.) I'm sorry, isn't Michael the least likable one in the family?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie," No. There are very few intelligent, attractive and straight men in this town."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Tobias," Well, that certainly leaves me out. (Chuckles.) She... she said single. You did say single, correct? I..."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,"George, Sr."," I didn't quite hear that. The reception's bad, but as the Talmud tells us... (static) ...to the jackal as to an oxen. (Chuckling.) Did we get a laugh?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B.," I'm sorry. I'm just still on the whole Michael-being-likable thing. You know that he's only had sex with, like, four women, right?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie, Let's focus on your likability. You're going to start doing some charity work with your magic.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay," Actually, I'm kind of the charitable one of the family."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie, I think it's best if you got a job.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay," Oh, come on! I'm a parent-I care about my daughter every bit as much as Michael cares about his son."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Maeby, What grade am I in?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay, What kind of job?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie," Something where you'll be seen. I represent Cloud Mir vodka, and they want someone to promote it by ordering it at a hot bar-a place like... Rud."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay," Okay, I'll do it."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie," And, Tobias, you're a medical doctor and you're living an absurd fantasy as an actor. It's time to get real."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Tobias," Wow. That's tough talk... but I like it. You're saying, land a major film."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie," I'm saying, get your medical license back. I've set up a hearing for tomorrow in Boston. Michael has generously donated $1,100 for your trip."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Tobias, (Laughs.) I'm sorry. I truly believe that the universe wants me to be an actor and not a doctor. I'm just waiting for a sign.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael,0
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Tobias, Any sign... really.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,"George, Sr."," Enough of that. I'm sorry. Some of my students, they're arguing the significance of the shank bone on the seder plate. (static) But that... do not wag our genitals at one another to make a point."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, Thought-provoking.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie," And, Lucille, people think you're cold."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,"George, Sr."," Okay, there's no need for violence! Hanukkah can be spelled so many ways. Oh, God!"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie, Buster.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Buster," Right here, ready to go, at your service, get me out there."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie, I want you to stay in. People find you odd and alienating. You make them uneasy. Stay out of the spotlight.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Buster, I shall be neither seen nor heard. Watch me.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille, You can always tell a Milford man.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator," Each with their new charge, the Bluths set about redefining their image. Tobias was off to Los Angeles International Airport determined to return to his family with a career."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Tobias," LAX. Oh, come on. We're stopping again? How many more stops are we going to make? Honestly, I haven't even seen this part of Los Angeles. Is that snow? Really now. This is ridiculous. I paid 12 American dollars."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Tobias," Oh, my God. You are Carl Weathers, the actor. I went to San Francisco to attend your stage-fighting workshop, but you never showed up."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Carl Weathers," I got bumped from that flight. Apparently, they give you $300 if you get bumped. It's this crazy loophole in the system that the wrong guy discovered. Guess where I won't be going?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Tobias, Yeah. So... I am an actor too.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Carl Weathers," Oh, good."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Tobias," Well, I want to be. I mean, without the proper training, I'm afraid I'm doomed to be a doctor."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Carl Weathers," Well, hell, I could train you."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Tobias," Oh, I'm afraid all I have is $1,100 and that's for this plane ticket."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Carl Weathers," Check this out. $1,100 is exactly what I charge for acting classes."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Tobias," No, it isn't."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Carl Weathers, Yeah.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Tobias," Well, what are the chances...? Universe, you've done it again."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator," Meanwhile, G.O.B. was beginning his charity work at a local nursing home."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B., I'm going to need a volunteer for my next illusion-The Aztec Tomb.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Woman, A tomb?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B.," Or box. Box is... fine. Oh, yes, well, excellent. Let's get you in the box. (Quietly.) There's a panel. Just flip it around. Curl up behind it. Don't make any noise, all right? (To audience.) Ancient lore has it the Aztec gods put a curse on any man who...."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Woman, What?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B., He's gone.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator, Buster was also doing his share for the family.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator," And Michael, at Jessie's insistence, was out on the town."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," I haven't been out to dinner in so long, I feel a little guilty."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie," Oh, you've nothing to be guilty about. You're the only one in your family who's ever been responsible."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Well, certainly the only one that's ever held a real job."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay," Oh, really, Michael, watch this. Wow, this Cloud Mir's making me think fuzzy. I've almost no judgment at all."

1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie," (To photographer.) Oh, good, get one of Michael and me on a date. Thank you."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, A date? This is a date now? I thought this was just business.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie, Can't it be a little bit of both?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, How will I know which part of it is business?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, Uh-oh. Can't wait to see which part of it is a date.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, Show me business again.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Maeby," Hey, whatcha doing?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael, Just trying to get the TV working.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Maeby," Oh, yeah. I tried that earlier. I think it's still hooked up to the prison."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael," So when those guys kept saying ""Hey, you, boy,"" that was me? I was the boy?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Maeby," Sounds like it. So, have you told your dad you don't want to go to that school?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael," No, I'm thinking of just going. I mean the graduates go on to do great things."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Maeby," I suppose, but that means we won't be going to the same high school."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael," Damn, it just keeps getting worse. He's my dad. I don't want to disappoint him."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Maeby, You and I are so different. It's like we're not even related.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael, That would be amazing.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael," Oh, my God."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Hey, buddy."

This girl's making some serious progress on getting you into that school. She just booked G.O.B. a gig at Earl Milford's nursing home. You're going to be a shoo-in."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael, Oh.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," She's kind of something, isn't she?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael," Yeah, I guess."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," I mean, you know, hey, she is no replacement for your mom."

1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie, Is he in bed?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," He's on his way. Hey, listen, listen. This might be a little bit too fast for him. I mean, for, for us. Me. For me. Maybe we should take a step back and just keep this relationship professional."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie," Oh, I think that would take all the fun out of it."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," No, no, no, seriously. You're amazing, but I just think we should slow down."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie," Uh-huh. So the two months on the bike-that was what, for my health?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, We had great conversations. Seriously. This is hard for me.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie," This is hard for me, too. I've got a life to get on track, and I don't like wasting time, so let's do this. Let's take two steps back and why don't you find yourself a new publicist?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Jessie... No, I was just saying your name as you walked away. I didn't... I have no follow-up."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, (Softly.) Jessie.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator," Michael felt bad, but he felt even worse when he got a call from his brother."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, Hello.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B., It's G.O.B. I'm looking for Jessie.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," She just left, G.O.B. What's wrong?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B., I need her to spin something for me.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Well, that's too bad, because I think she quit. What do you need her to spin?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B., Murder.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator, Michael was summoned to help his brother.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Murder, huh? Who died?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B., My career.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, I'm going to go home now.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B., I lost a guy. I put him in the Aztec Tomb and he disappeared.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, Isn't that the point?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B., This will ruin me.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, He's probably fine.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B.," No, I need Jessie."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Well, she quit when I told her that I couldn't go out with her. You know, I have to do the right thing for my son."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B., Then you better get her back because the guy I lost was Earl Milford.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, What?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B., I didn't know it was him. But he was spectacularly quiet in there. You can always tell a Milford man.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," G.O.B., have you destroyed my chance of getting my son in that school?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B., Not with the right spin. Jessie-get her back.

1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator, And the press got hold of G.O.B.'s story.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Reporter, Where's Earl Milford?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B.," I-I don't know. I put him in a box. I didn't kill him, all right? And don't edit this for your broadcast so it looks like I'm screaming, ""I killed Earl Milford!"""
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,John Beard,0
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator," Minutes later, G.O.B. unloaded his equipment and made a surprising discovery."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Earl Milford, Don't send me back. They abuse us. It's not pleasant.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B.," Earl, I have to take you back. It's the only way to clear my name."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Earl Milford, You'll have a new name - Hero.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B., Hero. That could work for me.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator," Meanwhile, Jessie decided to pay George Michael a visit."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie," Hi, George Michael. Proud of yourself?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael," Yeah, actually. I got a bum away from the stand without hurting his feelings. That was pretty sweet."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie," No, I mean about your father. About denying him his chance to be happy?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Maeby," You're into that, too? I'm rubbing off on you, huh?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael," No, I want my dad to be happy."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie," Oh, it's too late now. I've seen to that. Daddy lost his shot at happy, and it's all your fault, Opie."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator, Jessie had gone too far and she had best watch her mouth.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie, Michael's about to become the most unlikable man in town. (Breezily.) Check the papers.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Maeby, She kind of reminds me of my mother.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator," And later that night, Lindsay was working at Rud."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay, You seem like a man of taste and class.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Man at Bar," I'll give you $2,000 to touch me."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay," (Chuckles.) Oh, my God, my husband."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Man at Bar, You're married to Carl Weathers? (bleep)
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay, What's going on? Why are you here? Why aren't you in Boston? Who's he?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Tobias," His name is Carl Weathers, and he's my new acting teacher. And, Lindsay, he's teaching me all these valuable life lessons."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Carl Weathers, I buy all my cars at police auction.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Tobias," He's full of stuff like that. And, Lindsay, he's teaching me to follow my dreams."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay, Give me a bourbon.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Carl Weathers, Any room on that tab for me to jump on?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator, And Michael caught up with Jessie.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Thanks for coming. I was just doing some thinking, and I pulled away, and that was wrong. I really want to make this work."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille, Get away from my son.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Hey, Mom. Kind of on a date here."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille, You'll change your mind after this.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator, And Michael saw the story that Jessie had planted.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille," Let me tell you something, sweetie. We may pick on each other, get into little scrapes, call each other names and occasionally steal from each other, but that's because we are family. You have no right. You don't get to do that."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay," ""Lindsay's a combative, entitled princess""? I should hire somebody to kick your ass for that."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lucille, Save your money.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Lindsay, You're right. I'll do it myself.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! We are not settling things like that anymore, all right? I don't need my son reading any more articles about us in the paper."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie," Oh, you and your son. Stop using him as an excuse for everything you do. I saw him today. He's fine with us."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, What? You saw him today?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie, Yeah. I told him he was getting in the way of your happiness.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, You did? You said that to my son?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Jessie, Yeah.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, You're on your own. Ladies.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Woman in Restaurant," Hey, look out."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Man in Restaurant, Bluth fight!
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Trisha Thoon, The press is having a love affair with hating the Bluth family. And they were the center of another brawl this evening.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Carl Weathers," I'm looking at $50,000 worth of medical bills here."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Well, it looks like you won't be getting into this school. You disappointed?"
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael, Are you disappointed?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Look, George Michael, I want you to tell me how you feel, okay? I don't want you to worry so much about hurting my feelings."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael, I didn't want to go to that school and Jessie's a psycho.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, It could've saved us a little bit of time.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael," But, Dad, you know, if you ever want to date anyone else, that's fine with me."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," Yeah? Thanks, buddy."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael," 'Cause, you know, I mean, four women, that is kind of sad."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael," All right, thank you."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael," I mean, I know you got married in college, but that was your sophomore year. You had your whole freshman year."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Michael, That's enough honesty for now. Thank you. Good night.
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,George Michael, There must've been girls at parties?
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, G.O.B. holds a press conference of his own..."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,G.O.B.," And now prepare to call me hero. He's resting. Pick a card. Oh, boy."
1,Public Relations,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Public_Relations,Narrator, ... and Buster moves to the kitchen.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator, It was Michael's sister's anniversary and he'd convinced his mother to throw a party for her.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," Lindsay, how's this for an anniversary cake?"
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille, Anniversary? You asked me to throw a Valentine's Day party.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael, Did I?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille, You tricked me.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," I deceived you, Mom. Trick makes it sound like we have a playful relationship."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille," Touché. Lupe, untie the balloons!"
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Marta," Michael, all alone on Valentine's Day? How's that possible? You seem like such a romantic to me. I can just see you showing up on some lucky girl's porch, in a tuxedo with a bottle of champagne."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," Yeah. But if I show up with all that stuff, I could probably just get away with shorts and a T-shirt right? Which is good because I don't even have a tuxedo."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Marta, So you're saying there's no one that you're even interested in?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator," In fact, Michael had become enamored of Marta when G.O.B. was having second thoughts about the relationship."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,G.O.B., I've made a huge mistake.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator, But when G.O.B. recommitted to her...
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,G.O.B., I've made a huge mistake.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator, ...Michael decided to do the noble thing and let her go.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," There was somebody for a little while, but it was too much of a brother... bother."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lindsay, That can't feel good.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," It's fine. I'm over it. I'm okay by myself, you know? I really just want to focus on my family's happiness. That's why I threw this party. I mean, 14 years, huh? You've got to be doing something right."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lindsay," Well, if you call not filing for divorce something right. But I guess we keep it interesting."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael, Where's Tobias?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lindsay, He's on the balcony having margaritas with Carl Weathers.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator, Tobias had recently hired actor Carl Withers as a drama coach.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Tobias, Do you see me more as the respected dramatic actor or more of the beloved comic actor?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Carl Weathers," Whoa, whoa, whoa. There's still plenty of meat on that bone. Now you take this home, throw it in a pot, add some broth, a potato. Baby, you've got a stew going."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Tobias," Yes, that's fine, but I would like to focus on my acting, Mr. Weathers. I did give you my last $1,100."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Carl Weathers," Let me tell you a little story about acting. I was doing this Showtime movie-Hot Ice with Anne Archer-never once touched my per diem. I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup- baby, I got a stew going."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Tobias, I think I'd like my money back.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator," Like his father, George Michael had been nursing an impossible crush. It was on his cousin, Maeby. And with no one to talk to, he was looking for some kind of direction."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,George Michael, Just give me a sign. The first one's obvious. Okay.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator," He continued to look for a sign, until finally..."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,George Michael," ""Maybe tonight."" What are the chances?"
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator," Actually, ""Maybe Tonight"" was a very popular candy slogan and the chances were one in eight."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,George Michael, What are you doing?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Maeby," I'm just trying to throw stuff at my dad's head, but the wind keeps taking it."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,George Michael, How cool. So I found this. I thought it was like a one-in-a-million thing. It just made me think of you.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Maeby," Oh, perfect."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Tobias, I saw that.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator, And Lucille found a way to force a wedge into her son's relationship.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille," Lucille, guess who's coming to dinner? I've invited Carl to dine with us next Tuesday."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Buster," Mother, you know I have class on Tuesday."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille," Oh, how silly of me. Well, then perhaps the two of you can have dinner alone."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Carl Weathers," I never say no to dinner with a beautiful lady, that is."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille Austero, Do you like ham?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Carl Weathers, No. I love it.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator, And the family gathered to watch a videotape George had sent Lindsay and Tobias for their anniversary.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,George," Hello, I'm George Bluth. And for the next 45 minutes, let me take you on a journey."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille," Good grief, he sent us one of his idiot video tapes."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,George," First, this."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Announcer, You've seen George Bluth on videotape.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,George, You have got to learn to be alone. I cheated and I lied and I whored around.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Prisoner, Caged Wisdom changed my life.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Announcer, Now's your chance for only 4 payments of $19.95.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lindsay, This was supposed to be my anniversary.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille," Yeah, and this was supposed to be my Valentine's Day party. Speaking of which... Lupe, where are those balloons?!"
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lupe, You want balloons?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,G.O.B.," Speech, speech, speech,"
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,All," (Chanting.) Speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, speech, speech..."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator," The family continued to chant ""speech, speech, speech"" for no one in particular."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,All," ...speech, speech, speech!"
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," Gee, after all that, I was kind of hoping somebody would make a speech."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Buster," Speech, speech, speech!"
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," All right, I'll say something."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,G.O.B., Typical.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," We've all had a tough couple of months. I think we're all really figuring out who we are and what we really need in life, and that can be painful. However, you can't really heal yourself until you stop living a lie, you know? But I promise that we're all going to be a lot happier in the long run. So, on a very unusual Valentine's Day, cheers to Mom and Dad, to Buster and Lucille...."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Buster, Don't forget my girlfriend.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael, That's who I meant. ...To Lindsay and Tobias. To George Michael and... I almost said George Michael and Maeby.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,George Michael, (Laughing.) Oh.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," To G.O.B. and Marta. To love and happiness. I love you all, Marta."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator," And Marta realized that it was Michael, not G.O.B., who had everything she had been looking for in a man."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Marta, I've made a huge mistake.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lindsay, I was thinking about that toast you gave at my anniversary party. So I want to get a divorce.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael, What?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lindsay," Do you think I should use our attorney, Barry, or just kind of bolt in the night? I'm leaning towards bolt in the night, but..."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," Whoa, whoa, whoa."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," Lindsay, I wasn't talking about getting a divorce."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lindsay," Oh, Michael, it's time. The man's psychologically incapable of taking all of his clothes off."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator," In fact, Tobias was a never-nude. As of yet, the DSM-IV has not acknowledged the affliction."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," I don't know, Lindsay. I mean, who am I to judge? On the other hand, I am doing it anyway, so let me suggest before you talk divorce, at least consider a separation. You know, you do have a kid."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lindsay, I know. I was going to take her with me in the night. She's part of the bolt.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael, Lindsay.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lindsay," All right, I'll think about it."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael, (Into phone) Hello?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Buster," Hey, brother, I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your speech yesterday-about family and being true to ourselves."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," Oh... well, I'm glad it made an impact."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Buster, Yeah. I never want to look at mom again.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael, What happened?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Buster, I can't really talk. She might be listening in. Do you know she tried to set up my girlfriend with a man? It has to stop.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael, That's not really what I was going for.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Buster," I'm a man, Mike! I'm a man."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lupe, Can I throw out this yogurt?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," first of all, it might be time for you to move out and secondly, you don't want to take any chances with yogurt, Mom. Just let her throw it out."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille, Hello? Who's on this phone?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,G.O.B., Michael.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael, Hey.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,G.O.B., Great speech last night.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," Really? What did it inspire you to do, kill somebody?"
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,G.O.B., Getting there. Marta's cheating on me.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael, What?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,G.O.B., Yeah. Can you believe that?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," That's crazy, G.O.B. She's not a cheater. If she were to cheat, I'd like to think she'd cheat... you're the cheater."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,G.O.B.," That's how I know all the signs. Last night she was all distant and weird. Wouldn't let me make love to her on Mom's bed. I don't even want to tell you what she wouldn't let me do to her in the car. And then today, I overhear her talking on the phone about somebody, all super silently, all in Spanish."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator," In fact, Marta was on the phone with her mother talking about Michael."

1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Marta, Hermano.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,G.O.B.," And she kept using this guy's name like, ""Hermano."""
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," Let me tell you something, G.O.B. We're going to track this Hermano down, okay? And we're going to nail him. Because if anyone's going to go out with that girl, it's going to be one of us."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,G.O.B., Right. Me.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael, And I'm okay with that.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Maeby, I don't get it. Why do we have to change rooms?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lindsay, Cousins of the opposite gender shouldn't be sharing a room.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,George Michael," But that's just the point. I mean, we're cousins. You know, gender has nothing to do with it. Cousins can bunk together. That's why they call it ""bunking cousins."""
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lindsay," They call it ""kissing cousins."""
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,George Michael," We're not kissing, that's the point."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator," George Michael was concerned Tobias had seen the candy heart that said ""Maybe Tonight"" and had figured out that he had a crush on his cousin."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,George Michael," Besides, I don't even care. First you said, ""Share a room with her,"" I shared a room with her. Now you're saying don't share a room with her. Fine. I'm just... I'm just doing whatever you say. The adults are making all the decisions around here. Why am I in trouble?"
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lindsay, You're not in trouble. We're all just going to have a more normal arrangement. I'm going to sleep with my daughter and you're going to sleep with my husband.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator, Buster had taken Michael's advice and decided to confront his mother.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Buster," (Sniffling.) Because you know I don't appreciate how you treat me. I am not a child, Mother."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille, Blow.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Buster," No, Mother! I can blow myself. And you have interfered for the last time."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille, Fine. Go! Move out!
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Narrator," So, Buster loaded up his possessions and emancipated himself from his mother."

1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Buster, I thought you had class. My brother-in-law fires you and you move in on my girlfriend?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Carl Weathers," Now wait a minute. This is just purely a social call. You know, just two adults getting a stew on, man."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Buster," I don't know what that means, but it sounds disgusting."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille Austero," Hey, Buster. Gee, I thought you had class."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Buster, I thought you had class. I want to move in with you. I'm tired of my mom trying to control me.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille Austero," Wait a minute. Are you sure you're doing this because you want to be with me, and not because you want to get even with your mother?"
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Buster," This isn't about my mother. Besides, it's the only way I'm ever going to get her to respect me."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille Austero," Buster, this is exactly why our relationship does not work."

1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille Austero," No, not as long as you keep getting me all mixed up with your mother."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Buster, It is exactly the opposite. I'm leaving my mother for you. You're replacing my mother.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille Austero, You need some time.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Buster, Huh?

1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,George, He moved out? Buster did?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille," I know it's for his own good, but I'm worried."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,George," Well, he's going to be fine."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Lucille, I'm not worried about him. I've never lived in the apartment alone. I'm not sure I'm up to this.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,George," All right, shh, shh, shh. Listen, I know you think I'm going after the $49, but... I want... I want you to watch a little Caged Wisdom."

1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,G.O.B.," For some reason, women feel safe around you. Maybe because you've only had sex four times."

1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Tobias," See, nothing has ever been easy for us. I mean, the only reason she went out with me was to piss off her boyfriend. The only reason she ever married me was to piss off her mother. And, then, of course, we couldn't conceive, so there was that famous ordeal."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,George Michael," Wh-What do you mean, you couldn't conceive? Was Maeby adopted? Is she not really related to me? Is she just some girl I know?"

1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Marta, Don't go in there.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael, Is there something you don't want me to see?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Marta, What are you talking about?
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," You know, we can keep going around in circles, but maybe one of us should just come out and say what it is we want to say."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Marta, You're right. It's not working with G.O.B.
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Michael," Why doesn't he know that? You know you could've just come out and told him, you know, instead of lying and sneaking around and moving on to the next guy. I didn't think you were that kind of a person. You know, I thought you and I shared the same values. I thought you and I could have been, uh... Nah, forget it. I don't know how I had you so wrong."
1,Marta Complex,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Marta_Complex,Marta, You're right. I should have told him before I invited you here. This could never be.

1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B., What the hell is going on?! I'm waiting to hear about Marta and this Hermano guy.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael," Yeah, I checked it out. I do not think that she's cheating."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B., I'm going over to Marta's.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael," No, no, no. Don't-don't do that, okay? Just, uh, lay low. Be cool. I'll talk to her again. That way, you don't look so desperate, you know?"
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B.," You're a good guy, mon frère. That means ""brother"" in French. I don't know why I know that. I took four years of Spanish!"
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Narrator," So, Michael went to speak with Marta about the misunderstanding from the night before."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael, I owe you an apology.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Marta," No, I owe you an apology. I'm so ashamed that I was so disrespectful to your brother."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael," Oh, who cares? Nobody respects him. You see, Marta, I have been interested in you since the first day that we met."

1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael, That's enough.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael, We do have to do the right thing.

1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael, Very. Very. Wrong.

1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael, I got to tell G.O.B.

1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael," Yes, but-but you-you speak a little slowly, and I really want to get this thing moving along. So listen. You do the noble thing and you tell him you've met someone else. I'm going to do the noble thing and tell him that it's me. While I'm doing my noble thing, you could put those photos in a box, get rid of the wand, and we can do the wrong thing the right way."

1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Maeby, Nice cover. Why don't you two just get a divorce and save us all a lot of grief?
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Narrator," The night before, Tobias and Lindsay had chosen to sleep in separate rooms, and Tobias had dropped an intriguing piece of information."

1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,George Michael, Was Maeby adopted? Is she not really related to me? Is she just some girl I know?
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Narrator, George Michael never got an answer. So he set about doing some investigating of his own.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,George Michael," Hey, have you ever seen any pictures of your mom pregnant?"
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Maeby," Don't talk to me about my mom. She's crazy. Both of them are. Sometimes, I wish we weren't even related."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,George Michael," Hey, you know, maybe we're not. Because when you think about it, we don't really even look like each other."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Maeby," No, I was talking about my parents. God, what's wrong with this family?!"
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,George Michael," (To himself.) Maybe we're not family. And maybe that's very, very right, twinkie."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,George Michael," Uncle G.O.B.! Hey, uh, was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant?"

1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B.," She sure has. Four times, but I didn't take the calls."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael," Oh, no? Why not? Because of you. You said to lay low. And it's working. Great."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B.," Tell you what. You may not be good with women, but you are great with other people's women, I'll give you that."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael," Oh, listen, G.O.B., you can't just ignore her. Maybe you should talk to her. She is your girlfriend."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B.," Exactly! And I want to keep it that way. For all I know, she's calling to break up with me. I don't answer the phone, that doesn't happen."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B.," And it's all because of you, fratello. That's Italian for ""brother,"" yeah. Now all I gotta do is find this ""Hermano"" guy. I'm gonna kill him."

1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael," G.O.B., there's no need for violence. There never is. I'd like to think that we're all, you know, intelligent, mature... um... adults that-that can settle their differences-whenever they come to light-through words."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B.," Yeah, well, I let my fists do the talking. Not this one, 'cause obviously, I need it for coin tricks and stuff. But this one, I let it speak for both of them."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Mom always taught us to curl up in a ball and remain motionless when confronted. That's what I did in high school when I almost got into a fight."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael, I think that was about being attacked by bears.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster, Yeah. I know.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Bear," Hey, rich kid, give me your lunch money."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster, But sometimes I wonder what it would be like to get into a fight today.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael," Well, you'd be a much bigger ball."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster," I mean, there is so much in life that I have not experienced. And now that I'm away from Mom, I feel like this is my chance to live. I want to dance. I want to make love to a woman. I want to get a checking account. I want to know what it feels like to get my face socked in."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B.," Michael, don't get that. That could be Marta."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael, What? Ooh! (Whispers.) Too late. Hello?
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Lucille, Michael?
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael," Oh, hi, Mom."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster, I'm not here.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Lucille, Is that Buster? Tell him I'm fine without him. Why haven't you called me back? I'm worried about your father's hearing.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael," Mom, listen, it's going to be fine. I'm on it, okay? I'm taking care of it. I'll be there first thing Friday morning."

1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Lucille," Where is your head, Michael?"
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael," Listen, everything is going to be fine. They just read the charges, and we look like a loving family for, like, six minutes."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Lucille, Ten minutes.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael," We couldn't get that down, huh?"
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Narrator," George Michael, meanwhile, went to speak with Tobias."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,George Michael, This was just faxed to you.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Tobias, Oh great. The rewrite. Let's see if they beefed up my part. I got three lines.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,George Michael," So, uh, I've been thinking about that conversation we were having the other night about, uh, where Maeby came from. And uh, I was just wondering if you could finish that thought."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Tobias," Yes, okay, uh... Well, have a seat. Uh... um..."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Tobias," When a man... needs to prove to a woman that he's actual... When a man loves a woman, and he actually wants to make love, uh, to her, something very, very special happens, and uh, with deep, deep concentration and-and great focus, he's often able to achieve an erec..."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,George Michael," I'm sorry, I'm going to stop you. I know what you mean. I-I didn't mean babies in general."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Tobias," Oh, well that's good. Because it was about to get a little, eh, gross."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,George Michael," Yeah, no, I meant specifically with Maeby."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Tobias," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This isn't right."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,George Michael," I know, you're right. I'm sorry."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Tobias," No, no. It says it's a shower scene. I'm not supposed to be in the shower scene. It has nudity!"
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Narrator," Tobias was a never-nude, which is exactly what it sounds like."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Tobias, I don't do nudity. It says that right on my resume. Okay... what do you think I wear these for?
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,George Michael, I was never actually clear on that.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster," So... you're, uh... you're not with Marta anymore?"
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B.," Well, my plan is to get her wanting me but bad, and then I spring it on her. ""I know you've been cheating on me. You just cost yourself one fine man and one fine CD of him singing ‘Love is in the Air.""' (Eating dry spaghetti.)"
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster," Well, I would never, uh, do this while you were still going out, but, uh... if you're done with her, I'd sure like a crack at her."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B.," Right, right... That sounds great. Go for it, buddy."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B.," But you know that she's kind of used to being with me, right? So... it would be sort of like going from prime rib to-I don't know-weird brother of prime rib. So... Do you even know her?"
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster," I've met her. I fell for her. I've been watching her program. El amor prohibido. ""The Love that is Forbidden."" She is the love that's forbidden. The love of my hermano."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B., Wait a second. What? You know Hermano?
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster," Hermano is brother in Spanish, as in ""Hey, hermano."""
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B.," Brother... ""hermano"" means ""brother""?"
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster, Yeah.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B., Well... sounds like hermano is about to get his ass kicked.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster," Well, this is what I said I wanted. So? Alright, let's get it over with."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster, So... so you are you going to hit me?
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B.," No, I'm not going to hit you. You're not the brother Marta's cheating on me with."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster," Oh, who is?"
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B.," How should I know, Buster?"
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster," You know, there is a guy who plays her older brother on her show. I think his name is Tio."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,G.O.B.," Tio. Well, sounds like someone who you think's name is Tio is about to get his ass kicked. Thanks for the tip, Buster."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael," All right, Mom, I'll be sure to tell Buster. Right, bye. Mom wanted me to tell you she doesn't care whether you live or die, but if you're not dead, she would like to see you at the courthouse tomorrow in a blue sweater."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster, Damn it! I hate the blue sweater.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael, She said it would look nice with the gray pants.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster, Damn it! She's right!
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael, Where's G.O.B.?
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster, I think he's heading down to the set of Marta's soap opera.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael, What?
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster," Get this. She may be cheating on him with the guy who plays her brother. I mean, I still like her but we're going to have to deal with this."
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Michael, I've got to go stop them.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Buster, And I've got a blue sweater to steam.
1,Beef Consommé,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Beef_Consomm%C3%A9,Narrator," G.O.B. raced to confront Tio with Michael in hot pursuit. George Michael, having failed to get the information he needed from anyone else, made the ultimate sacrifice, and went to the keeper of the family secrets."

1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Can't wait to meet her at Parent-Teacher Night.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," Oh, yeah, Dad. And, Dad, try to remember everything she says about me."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Okay.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lucille, Michael? I need you to do something about my son.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," I totally agree, Mom. Buster goes home. We flip the mattress. This never happened."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lucille, Not Buster. Read this.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Did you and Dad adopt a child?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lucille, The SEC was on to us. Your father thought it would make us look charitable. He must have forged my signature.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lucille," Well, maybe I'll get a son who will finish his cottage cheese."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lucille, You've got to get me out of this.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," I'll call Social Services, but you must take Buster back."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lucille, Okay. Great. But I'm not taking care of him either. I... I don't have the milk of mother's kindness in me anymore.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," That udder's been dry for a while though, hasn't it?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Hello.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B., Michael. I got a couple of girls here-a couple of fun girls - I thought I'd bring you in on.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Ooh, I don't know, G.O.B."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," Come on, Michael. So we had a little disagreement."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator," Recently, G.O.B. had discovered that Michael was interested in his now ex-girlfriend Marta."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B., I'm offering you an olive branch here.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Yeah, yeah, no, I know, and I... I appreciate that."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," Besides, when was the last time you slept with someone?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Buster.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, What time and place?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator," Meanwhile, Lindsay was helping George Michael with his homework."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lindsay," Oh, come on, let's do something. It's just a stupid essay."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," I can't. I don't want to let down Miss Baerly. She's nice, you know?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lindsay, She's interesting... And pretty?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," Well, I don't know why I'm telling you this. I guess there's just some things you can't always say to your dad."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lindsay, Ah. sounds like you'd like her to be more than just your teacher.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator, Lindsay believed that George Michael wanted to fix up his father so she could fill the role of his mother.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lindsay, There's nothing wrong with that. Although... I must say I'm a little hurt that you haven't considered me.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael, You're my aunt.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lindsay," That doesn't matter. Aunts can fill that role. Teachers can fill that role. And, someday, you're going to find the right woman to fill that role. But until then... I'll be right across the hall."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator, Lindsay had never been more proud of anything she had said in her entire life.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael, Yikes.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator," Meanwhile, G.O.B. was waiting for Michael to show up."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," Oh, there he is. Michael."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Yes.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," This is Shannon, the girl I've been telling you all about."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Yes. Girl, indeed. Young girl. That's a young, young, young girl."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," Yeah. Well, she's 18, so it's, like... Oh, and this is your date, Nag..."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Nazhgalia, Shelley.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Hell... Oh, my God."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," Well, Shannon wouldn't go out without a chaperone, so..."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Right.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B., She's your date.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator," It was clear that G.O.B. wasn't offering an olive branch at all, and, in fact, was still harboring some resentment over Marta."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," (Chuckling.) Oh, Nagarmat, you've got a mustache. I mean you've got milk on your mustache. Oh. I mean, you've got a milk mustache."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Yeah. It's adorable. You look like one of those ""Got milk?"" models."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator," But G.O.B. mistook Michael's basic human decency for a romantic interest, and felt a competitive urge to step in."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," You know, he's beyond adorable. Exotic. I find you very attractive."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,"Michael, Nazhgalia, &amp; Shannon", Really?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator, And George Sr. was about to get a surprise visitor.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Cindi Lightballoon," Mr. Bluth, I'm Cindi Lightballoon. I've studied all your teachings, and I've purchased every tape, and I watch them over and over."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator, George Sr. had recently marketed a line of self-help tapes touting his newly discovered spirituality.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Cindi Lightballoon, I've also lost four pounds on your low-carb Bluth Banana Jail Bars. I've come to learn at your feet.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,"George, Sr.", That's a good place to start.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator," And Michael, free of his double date, met Lindsay at Parent-Teacher Night."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Hey, Linds, is it my imagination, or does this rape room have the same floor plan as our kitchen?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lindsay, Did you meet Miss Baerly yet? The Ethics teacher? Because I just did.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, No. Not yet. Look. These are our cabinets.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lindsay," Well, I think she's perfect for you."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," For me? Really? Thanks, but no, Lindsay. I've already been set up once today by a sibling, and I don't think you people know my type."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lindsay," Hey, look, it's not coming from me. It's George Michael. He told me. I think he wants a mother."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Well, that's ridiculous. He's got you. He's got our mother. You'd think that would turn him off the entire concept. Besides, I'm not going to rush out and marry somebody just because you think my son would like it."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly," Welcome. I'm Miss Baerly, the Ethics teacher. My goal is to teach your children about the preciousness of life that can be lost by the mindless pulling of a trigger."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Mmm. No ring.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator, And so Michael got to know his son's Ethics teacher.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Ethics. Right and wrong. How can one thing be right and another one be wrong? I mean, which is which, you know? I guess that's the ""Urgh!"" of it, you know? So frustrating."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly," I don't know. I mean, they just threw this class at me after Mr. Daniels had a stroke."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Oh!
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, I had him-Mr. Daniels. How is he?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly," Oh, he, you know, had a stroke."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Oh. I thought you were joking.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly, No. I was just laughing 'cause you were laughing.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Right, no. Yeah. Gosh. Hmm. Urgh!"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly," Urgh! But, you know, I really am anti-war and anti-violence, and I think I'm an ethical person."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Right. Here's an ethical question. Can a parent take a teacher out for a drink or...?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly, I don't know. Do you have a wife?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Yeah. But she's dead.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly, Oh.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly, Have you ever been married?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Yeah. She died.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly," Oh, God. Why are we laughing?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," I don't... Well, the Mr. Daniels stroke thing all over again. Let's go get that drink."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly, Yeah. It can only help.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Urgh!
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly, Urgh!
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator, George Sr. was dealing with his own admirer.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Cindi Lightballoon," Oh, I've already told you so many of my sins. Maybe you could tell me some of yours."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,"George, Sr."," Yeah, well there are legal implications to that, but... back to your sins. Do that one about the ladies' shower in your college dorm again."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator, And Michael was on his way to what would be his second date with Miss Baerly.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lucille," Michael, the little Korean is here, and I don't know what to do with him. At least I think it's a him. You've got to strip them down to next to nothing before you could even tell."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Yeah. Mom, I just spoke to Social Services and, although they don't like to do this, if you can prove that it's a bad environment for a child, and I would suggest saying what you just said to me. Don't change a word. They will take him back."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lucille," Ha, ha, ha. (To Annyong.) Don't get too comfortable. Shoes on, Mister. Shoes on. (Into phone.) He's out of control. Hold on."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Buster, I'm back. Who's that?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Annyong, Annyong.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lucille," This is Annyong, who your father and I have adopted."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Buster," What? I'm gone for a couple days, and you find a new son?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator," Lucille could see that her son was concerned, even jealous, and she knew how it felt to be overlooked."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lucille, Yes. Annyong is your brother now.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Annyong, Annyong.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lucille, Yes. Annyong. (Into phone.) Excuse me. Michael? Call it off. I'm keeping him.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Look, I have to call you back."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly, Sweet ride. Are you making dinner reservations?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," No, no. That was my mom. She just had a little Korean dropped off."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly," Ooh, that sounds good. Let's have that."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Restaurant Staff, Annyong.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Hello.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator," And after their date, Michael took a step he hadn't taken in years."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Okay, do you think this is a good idea?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly, I think it's a great idea.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Such a good idea.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly, How are we going to sneak in without waking everyone up?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, We'll take the stairs. This may not have been my best idea.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Nazhgalia," I'm sorry, Michael."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," I'm sorry, too, Michael, but... looks like we're even. You took something I liked, I took something you liked. Yeah. I [bleep]ed Nazbakalijan."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Listen, I know that you've been trying to get even with me about Marta, but got some bad news for you-I'm seeing somebody else."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B., Who? Who? Just out of curiosity. I'm not going to try to sleep with her.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Forget it. I thought that this was behind us.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B., It is behind us.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Great.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," When I sleep with her. 'Cause I'm going to sleep with her. Yeah. I was lying just then, when I said I wasn't going to sleep with her."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," 'Course she'd have to agree to it, G.O.B."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," Oh, I don't anticipate a problem with that, guy."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, No?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B., No. Because I've seen some of the dogs that you like.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Right.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B., I just slept with one.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Again. Didn't like Nazhgalia.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B., Really?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Really. And good luck getting rid of her.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," Oh, please. Not a problem. She knows it was a one-time thing. Totally cool."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, So romantic.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B., Who's N. Bahn-Ahden? (Into phone.) Hello.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Hey, George Michael. Wanted to talk to you about something before, but I didn't know if it was real, but now, um... your Ethics teacher..."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael, Yeah. I just made this for her.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Oh.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," Yeah, she loves Saddam Hussein."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," I'm sure she doesn't love Saddam. I'm sure she is interested in him as a subject, you know?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael, Right. That's what I meant.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Yeah. Great.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," You know, I just wanted to make her something special to show that I care."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, About the class?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," No, I mean about her."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Oh.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael, I kind of love her.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," You mean, you love her like... like she loves Saddam, right?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," No, no. I mean, like, love her, love her."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Oh. Oh.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly," Oh, hi. Hi, George Michael. I was just looking at this model home. I'm going to go home and think about it. I'm going to go home and think about it."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," Dad, what was she doing here? I mean, she wasn't..."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator, Michael knew he had an ethical responsibility to tell his son the truth.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Yes. Your Uncle G.O.B. slept with her.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael, Why would he do that? Why would G.O.B. sleep with my Ethics teacher?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Probably just to get even with me.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael, How would that be getting even with you? I'm the one that likes her.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Right. Right. No, I know. You and I know that, but G.O.B., you know, he's not that exact of a target shooter. He just kind of sprays it everywhere. But listen, did you really think that you had a... I mean, she's kind of old for you, don't you think?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," We don't even know how old she is. No one does. She was chaperoning the Diversity Dance and I thought, like, maybe as a joke thing, I'd go up to her and be like, ""Oh, hey, do you want to dance?"" And she'd be like, ""Eh, what the heck,"" right? Or something, I don't know. I did it differently in the mirror, but..."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Right.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," Like, it would like be joke dancing or something. I didn't think it through."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Don't you think you should be taking somebody your own age to the dance, like your cousin? Bad example, but..."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael, I feel so stupid. I defaced a rare book to get that picture of Saddam Hussein in a bathing suit.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," ""What would Saddam do?"""
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," Yeah. Yeah, you know something? You're right. G.O.B.'s going to pay."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Okay, that is our exact outdoor fire pit."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator," At prison, George Sr. was preparing for an evening with his most devoted fan, while Cindi Lightballoon was making preparations of her own."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Cindi Lightballoon, How we doing?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Agent Harris," We have video. Testing, one, two."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Agent Cummings," Tilt back a little, will you, Harris?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Cindi Lightballoon, Let's bust this guy.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator," So George Michael, still angry at G.O.B., sought out the family expert on making trouble."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Maeby, I know he was dating that girl Shannon.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael, The cheerleader?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Maeby," Yeah, she's probably going to take him to that stupid Diversity Dance. I wish I had someone shocking to take. You know, I actually called Mr. Daniels and asked him, but he got all out of breath and dropped the phone. I never heard back."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," You know, maybe we should go together. All right, I mean, it's a bad example, I just... but should we?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Buster, Hello.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Annyong, Annyong

1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Buster," Oh, I'm sorry. This is Annyong."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Annyong, Annyong.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Buster, My mom bought him. She's making me register him for school. He's my new little brother.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Maeby," So we're related. Hey, do you want to go to a dance?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," Oh, great, another uncle to compete with."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator, And Michael went to discuss the George Michael situation with Miss Baerly.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly," Being held against their will, purely on the basis of political or religious beliefs. (Chuckling.) I'm sorry. I met someone. I'm sorry. Anyway, this is serious. This is atrocities. No more smiling. Uh, just a minute."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Hi, sorry."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly," Hey! Don't worry, George Michael's not in there. Those are the dumb kids."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Okay. Um... Listen, this is, uh..."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly, Wow! Did you make this for me? This is so sweet. I love Hussein.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, You mean you're interested in him.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly," Oh, yes. He is a monster. Wow, where did you find this one of him in a Speedo?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," This is what I wanted to talk to you about, though. Beth, I don't think that I can continue to see you. I mean, I've enjoyed my time with you. You want to talk ethics..."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly," You really mean it. This isn't one of ""My wife died"" jokes?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," No, I'm afraid this is serious. You see, George Michael made this poster for you. You know, he kind of, uh, is in love with you, so..."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly, He knows we're going out. He saw me this morning.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," No, no. I covered that. I told him that you slept with my brother."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly, That may be the most unethical thing I have ever heard.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Well, you've only been doing this half a semester. Look, it was a preemptive strike. My brother would have tried to sleep with you."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly," Well, I want you to leave right now and not come back."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," I know. I understand. I'm sorry. And uh, you will not see me again. Starting right now."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator, George Sr. went on a walk with Cindi and she was getting to him.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Cindi Lightballoon, You can feel safe to fully reveal yourself to me.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,"George, Sr.", All right. There is... There is something. Come closer.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,"George, Sr."," It's weighed heavy on my soul. Uh... You know, the Talmud teaches us to... There you go."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Agent Harris," Oh, you're kidding me. He's on to us. He's found the camera."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Agent Cummings, Get out of there. He's got the camera. Abort. Abort. Clean the dog. We are cleaning the dog.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator," That night, Buster came home to an empty apartment."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Buster," So, it's off with mother now."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator," In fact, Lucille was just giving Annyong and Maeby a ride."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Buster," You're trying to steal from the wrong man. Watch your back, my little immigrant friend."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator, And the Spring Diversity Dance was in full swing.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Steve Holt, Whoa. Sorry. Students only.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Maeby," Oh, so you're not letting him in because he doesn't share your perfectly shaped nose, your round eye-shaped eyes, your strong square jaw?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Steve Holt, Thanks. You want to dance?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Maeby, Yeah.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Steve Holt," All right, come on."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Maeby, Steve Holt!
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator, And G.O.B. sought out Shannon...
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B., Shannon!
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator, ...who had found out he had cheated on her with Nazhgalia.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," Shannon, where are you! Shannon! Oh, hey, Lisa. Shannon! Excuse me. Look. I blew it, okay? But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Beth? Hey. Hi. Listen, um, I blew it, okay? I had to see you. I've been giving this a lot of thought and I have to do the right thing."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly, You're going to tell George Michael the truth?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Oh, that's your definition of the right thing. Uh, I kind of thought is was to make a big dramatic entrance and tell you that I wanted to see you. Okay, I'll get right on that. George Michael? Where are you? George Michael!"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael, Uncle G.O.B.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B., George Michael. What are you doing at a high school dance?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael, I'm looking for you. How could you do this to me?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B., Do what? I'm just here with my girl.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," Yeah, my Ethics teacher."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Hey, George Michael..."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," Dad, I'm taking care of something okay? (To G.O.B.) You slept with my Ethics teacher."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Whoa, whoa. Just hang on a second. It wasn't him. It's me, okay? I've been dating your Ethics teacher."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," Wow, Michael. I'm really touched that you'd stick up for me after I've been so horrible to you."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, Hmm?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," You know what, now it's time for me to do the right thing. I slept with the Ethics teacher. I'm sorry."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael, What are you talking about?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," Lindsay told me that you liked her, and I'm not proud of this, but... I (bleep)ed Mrs. Whitehead."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator," In fact, G.O.B. mistook the Civics teacher for the Ethics teacher Michael was dating."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," Man, he... has a type."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," G.O.B., Mrs. Whitehead was the Civics teacher. We both had her."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," Yes, we have and now we're even."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Shannon, What a pig.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B., Tell me about it.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Shannon," No, you. You're the pig. Two strikes, you are out."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B.," Oh, listen, Shannon, please, it was a one-time thing. I'm not going to even hear from her again. "
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,G.O.B., Oh! Who is Edna W.? Hello? Ooh!
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," Hey, what's going on here, Dad?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Well, it-it-it was me, okay? I-I've been seeing Miss Baerly, and I should never have brought G.O.B. into it, but that day you told me that you liked her, I didn't know what else to do. I never wanted to hurt you."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael," Well, didn't Aunt Lindsay tell you that I liked her?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Yeah, she did, but she said that you wanted her as a mother and I said that that was ridiculous, but then I met her and I kind of fell for her and thought that she would kind of make a great mother."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly, Is that true? I didn't know you were that serious.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Well, you know, I'm open to it. We're open to it."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly," Wow. No, no, no, no."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," I'm just saying someday, you know?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly, I'm not really into kids.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Michael," Well, I'm just, I'm not trying to rush anything."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Jeremy," Hey, the lady said no, man."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly," Look, Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for. I mean, we had some laughs about some very sad things, but I don't think we have a future. And Jeremy, I will take that cupcake."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Jeremy," Oh, okay, um... Hey, uh, you want to dance?"
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Beth Baerly, Sure. Why not?
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,George Michael, I can't believe that would have worked.
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, Buster's competition heats up."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Buster," Whoa, whoa, whoa! We are not allowed to have candles in here. Mom would freak."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Lucille," Oh, no, it's fine. This is America, baby. You pray how you want."
1,Shock and Aww,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Shock_and_Aww,Buster, Fine. I'll light a candle of my own. That's exactly what I'll do.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator," Michael had begun to work weekends. Unfortunately, this interfered with the Saturday morning bike ride he usually took with his son."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," So this isn't bad, right? Just like a normal Saturday."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,George Michael," You know, Dad, you don't have to drive so slow. I can ride my bike by myself."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, This actually doesn't go any faster.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,George Michael," I mean, I know you have a lot of work, you know?"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," That still doesn't mean I can't hang out with my... Hang on, one second. (Into phone.) This is Michael. Mom, I'm expecting a very important phone... For God's sakes, I'll be right there."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,George Michael, Dad. Dad!
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Nice instincts, son! Good reflexes!"

1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay, (bleep) me.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Tobias," Nope. Nothing. Thanks for trying, though. You know what I ought to do? I ought to check myself into a men's penal colony. Perhaps... your father could get me in."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay," Well, if he can go to work, so can I."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator," Lucille, meanwhile, was growing closer to her recently adopted Korean son, whom she called Annyong ..."

1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Buster, I'm a scholar. I enjoy scholarly pursuits.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lucille," Suddenly, playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit."

1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator, Buster had an unfortunate encounter in a photo booth on the wildlife-populated island of Catalina.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," No, Lupe is. You see, for her, a family reunion might actually be a pleasant experience."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lucille," They've got a bus, and they want to use parking lot to this building as a meeting place. I mean, for God's sake, it's not a hardware store. We can't have them hanging around like a bunch of freeloaders looking for an easy buck."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," What's the emergency, Mom?"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lucille, I need money.

1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Illusion, Mom. And I'm the president of that company, and I believe that I'm the one that asked you to start shopping at Quantity Plus."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lucille, And they made me apply for a membership card. It was humiliating.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," I'll see what I can do for you. And now that I know that I'm the one that pays Lupe, I'm giving her the day off, okay? Lupe, did you hear that? Tell your bus driver that he can pick up your family at the Bluth Company parking lot."

1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Anyway, you enjoy that paycheck when you get it. It will be the last one I ever send here."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Buster," Uh, does that mean I have to go to your office to get mine, too, or... how's that work?"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," You got to be kidding me. All right, you know what, Buster? Bob, in the copy room, he quit today. If you want your money, you're gonna have to work for it."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Buster," Okay, I accept. I'll take that job. I will work in the copy room."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lucille," I wouldn't go in there without knocking, Michael."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Now, I know we've been putting in a lot of hours, but we've got to keep our heads down and power through, you know, and sacrifice."

1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Guys, go ahead and take a three. Lindsay, how can you just come in here and ask me for a paycheck?"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay," Well, I usually ask Kitty, but she's not around, and you're the only one here that I've ever seen before."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, How long has this been going on?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay, Dad hired me out of college.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, You quit college.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay," Yeah, well, I had a job-what was the point?"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Well, you have a job now, and since Kitty's gone, you can earn your check by answering the phone."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay," Michael, it's Friday. Everybody coasts on Friday."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, It's actually Saturday.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay, Finally. I'm out of here. I'll see you Tuesday.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," I'm serious, Lindsay."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay, This is why your employees hate you.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," They're actually quite fond of me. Okay, guys, back to the staff meeting."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Buster," Sorry, guys."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Uh, Lindsay. Hello. The phone?"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay," Well, you said staff."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," The zoning committee feels that we're trying to squeeze too many units onto a lot this size, and obviously we need to if we want to make a profit, so how do we fit these units on there?"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay, Are these florescent lights bothering anybody else besides me?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, That's not what I want to deal with today.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay," Well, you and I have different management styles. I believe work should be fun and you try to crush people's spirits. What's next, Michael? Are you going to make dancing illegal? Is this the tiny town from Footloose?"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Can you go to your desk, please? Be like Buster. He's been in the copy room. I haven't seen him all day."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator," In fact, Buster had grown anxious in the confined space of the copy room."

1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Man #2, Bob!
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Voices, (Echoing.) Bob? Bob? Bob? Bob?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Buster," I need a different job. I'm having real trouble in a confined, indoor space. Hey, coworker."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, How do you feel about working outdoors?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Buster, Uh... What else do you have?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator," At the banana stand, George Michael was also working."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Maeby, I thought your dad worked last weekend.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,George Michael," No, last week he had to finish planning the new subdivision."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Maeby, Oh. So did he finish it?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,George Michael," No. Hey, are you trying to make me feel bad."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Maeby," Yeah, I guess. Sorry, I'm just bored."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,George Michael, That's okay.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Maeby, I guess he just likes work more than he likes you.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator, Tobias went to prison in preparation for his own work.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Tobias, I have a letter of introduction here from Carl Weathers.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator," Fortunately, the new warden was an appreciator of the arts."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Warden Gentiles, It would be an honor to have you research in this institution.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Tobias," (Quietly.) Oh, thank you."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Warden Gentiles," And, if I may, I have this script I'd love to get to Carl."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Tobias, O... kay.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Warden Gentiles, The warden could easily be black.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Tobias," Oh, yeah."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Warden Gentiles," Okay. Let's see, now. 187 won't be free till Tuesday... at midnight. And I can't put you into 212 because there's already another actor researching a role in there. (Quietly.) Steve Buscemi."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Tobias," Oh. Rea... Well, I-I would like to bunk with my father-in-law."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Warden Gentiles, Okay. Let's get you... into wardrobe.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Tobias, (Laughs.) Wow! Prison.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator," Meanwhile, Michael and Buster had arrived at the construction site, and Buster was actually starting to enjoy himself."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Buster, Michael! I'm reinforcing the header!
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," That's great, buddy. Listen, uh, also, I know that we're behind on the payroll, but as soon as the zoning committee gives me their approval, I know the bank's gonna release the money. Right now I'm just asking everyone to, you know, power through, sacrifice."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Foreman," I'll try, but these guys have been working too hard not to get paid."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," I'll get on it, but until then, you know, I've got Buster here to help, that's another guy."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,G.O.B., Michael! Michael. Michael.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, How'd you know I was here?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,G.O.B.," I called the office. You know, that Kitty is starting to sound pretty damn sexy to me. Maybe I ought to..."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, That was Lindsay.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,G.O.B., Anyway.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, Yeah.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,G.O.B., What's Busty doing here?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Buster, Michael got me the job.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,G.O.B.," How'd you get him to do construction? The guy's, like, the world's biggest chicken. Coka, coka, coka."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Buster, I'm not a chicken.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Yeah, he's not a chicken. He just doesn't like confined spaces, that's all."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,G.O.B., I thought it was open spaces.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Buster," No, it's both. But I love it here. And the language these guys use. Rough! One of the guys told me to take my head out of my bottom and get back to work. (Cackling laughter.) My bottom! (Laughing.)"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, What do you want? You want your paycheck?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,G.O.B.," I usually get cash under the table. But if you made it out to ""Cash""..."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Well, I got bad news for you, G.O.B."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Foreman," Hey! Pick up the pace, douche bag!"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,G.O.B., Michael.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Foreman," You too, candy ass."

1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, What happened to the lights?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay, Isn't this better? Doesn't this just want to make you curl up and forget about the world?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Lindsay, we need the lights so that people... Where are these people going?"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay, I'm taking them out to lunch.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, Did you reserve a restaurant? Are they taking their own cars?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay," Oh, they'll figure something out."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," No, they won't. You don't have a plan? I told you these people are sheep, and they'll wander off and you'll lose the sheep. You've lost the sheep."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay," Oh, they'll be fine."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator," In the parking lot, the employees boarded the bus Lupe had rented for her family reunion, thinking Lindsay had reserved it for lunch."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Well, I need this proposal, I don't know how they can walk off and just hope..."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay," Right here, Michael."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, Hm?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay," You weren't here, and everything got done while I was in charge. See? Not so hard what you do."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," You just got lucky this once. You really think I could leave here, and everything would be fine?"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay," I think everything will be fine, but you? I don't think you can leave."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Well, Lindsay, if I didn't have that phone call from the zoning committee..."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay, You'd have no reason to live. I'll have it forwarded to your cell.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, Great! I'll leave. Not a problem. I can spend some time with my son. So you're in charge. Try not to bring the whole company down.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay, Like that's even possible.

1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,White Power Bill, I got worse plans for you if you keep trying to convert my team.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,"George, Sr."," Okay, hold on. Hold it now, hold it.

1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay," Oh, no, he can get that call anywhere. I just have to forward it to him. Hey... would you mind running things for a little while?"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,George Michael," Well, I'm-I'm not really..."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay, It's not hard.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator, And so Lindsay headed off to deal with the work stoppage problem at the site.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator," Lindsay knew Michael would be furious if he found out the building had stopped, so she had to find a way to start it, and that's when she came across Lupe's family."

1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Oh, no. Where is... where's my phone?"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Boy #1," I used it to dig the ""B"" unit."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, You what?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Boy #1, I'll get it.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Oh, no! You're going to ruin it! What am I doing?"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, Hello?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,George Michael," Hi, Dad."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Hey, George Michael, where are you?"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,George Michael," I'm at the office. Lindsay put me in charge here 'cause there's nobody here, and she had to go to the construction site 'cause the workers stopped working."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Oh, great. Now we're never gonna finish phase three, and everything's gonna fall apart. This whole thing is gonna cave in, and we're gonna be left with a bunch of... Great. Now my sand castle has a giant pool in it."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator, And that's when Michael saw the solution to his space problem.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," I got to go, buddy."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,George Michael, He's making a sand castle?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator," George Michael noticed something, too. He knew his father had always loved him, but at this moment, he was actually holding the proof in his hands. Unfortunately, it was at this moment that the investigators went into action."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Agent Harris, There's a kid.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Agent Cummings, Cover is blown. Get out.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Agent #3, I've got a clean shot over here.

1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Agent Harris, Get the proof. He's got the evidence file.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Agent Cummings, I told you to find a stud!
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator," And back at the construction site, Buster and G.O.B.'s showdown was reaching a dramatic conclusion."

1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator," And for the first time, G.O.B. saw his brother as a man."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,G.O.B.," Let's get back to work, guys."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Construction Worker, Go to hell. Let's get...
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator," And Lindsay arrived... suddenly, trying a new management style."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay," Okay, so you guys don't want to work? Fine. I've got a stair car full of Mexican laborers that would love a day's work."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lupe's Uncle, Laborers? I'm a professor of American studies at the University of Mexico City.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Buster, I took a dance class there.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lupe, I thought you were taking us to Catalina. What happened to Catalina?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Foreman," You'd bring in scabs, just like that?"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay, Watch me. Go to work!
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! We're shutting it down."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay," Michael, I've solved this."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," No, it's not you. It's me. It's wrong. The plan is wrong. We got to get rid of the individual swimming pools and put in a great big communal one right in the center. And, Lindsay, you were right. We've all been working a little bit too hard. You can't manage by threatening and pushing people. And sometimes you have to reward hard work. Maybe reward it with a party."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael, I didn't mean tonight- just sometime in the future when we have some extra food and liquor.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lucille," Lupe! Lupe, I need help with the groceries!"
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Lindsay, How about just liquor?
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Narrator, And the two Bluth men finally did relax.
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,Michael," Thanks for coming out, buddy. I've been dying to get some time with you, I really have."
1,Staff Infection,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Staff_Infection,George Michael," That's okay. I know how much you care about me. Unfortunately, so does the federal government. Want more punch?"

1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, Really? There's a chance we don't have to go to trial?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry," Absolutely, and I say we take it because we will never get an offer this good again."

1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Hooker," No, baby, I'm the real thing."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, I don't understand how a person can put their sex life in front of their work.

1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry," Can we get back to work, folks? We've only got 24 hours to respond and no matter what this is, it is better than going to trial."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Lucille, Your father's not here. I'll speak for him. He loves it-he's crazy about the plea. He's dying to get out of that prison and be with a woman again.

1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B., It's pretty thick.

1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, So tell me something personal about yourself.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie," Uh, well, I have an irreversible case of ocular retinoblastoma."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," Hey, I thought we said no more law talk."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, I really can't see anybody right now.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie," Well, I can't see anybody ever."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie, I'm blind.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, I'm wasted!
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator, Michael realized that the woman he was attempting to never see again was blind and he was overcome with guilt.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, When... can we go out again?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie," Really? I thought you were, like, just into this one-night stand kind of thing."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, Come on. I took a blind woman home with no intention of dating her again. Please!
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator, George Sr. was continuing to exploit his relationship with Cindi.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr."," What-What evidence does the government have on old wise George, by the way?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Cindi Lightballoon," Oh, I hate when you call yourself old. You're new to me!"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr."," Oh, that's-that's nice. Do they have a-a file or tapes, or a...?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Cindi Lightballoon," Oh, what's the use? You're married."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr.", Yeah. L-Let me ask you...
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Cindi Lightballoon, We'll never be together.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr.", Let me ask you a question.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Cindi Lightballoon, Let's just go back to what we do best.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr.", Okay.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Cindi Lightballoon, Tweak me.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr.", Oh.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Lucille, George!
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr.", Lucille. Hi. This is not what it looks like.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Lucille, It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr."," Yep. Yeah, that's it."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Lucille," Is this why you wanted to fight this thing, so you could run off with this great redwood of a whore?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr.", Listen to me. She is a fan of mine. She has seen everything I've done. You understand? Everything.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Lucille," Well, so have I. And I'm not going to put up with it anymore."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr.", Okay.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Lucille, You'll be hearing from Barry.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr."," All right, hon? Honey? Hon?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Cindi Lightballoon," God, I'm a home-wrecker. I never wanted to be that person."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr."," No, no, no, no. Cindi, it's... Cindi?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator," Michael came home, upset that his one-night stand wasn't over."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.," You should have stayed with me last night. You could have seen me get some major action from a major blonde. Who just majored in marine biology, if you know what I mean."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, I-I don't know what you mean. I can't imagine what that means. I actually had a pretty interesting night myself.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.," Really? What'd you do, read the plea?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," No, I didn't have a chance to. I went home with someone."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B., What's wrong with her?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, Nothing's wrong with her. She's blind.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B., Are you serious?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, I didn't know at the time. And now I've got to take her and her dog to the park.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B., You've got work to do. You've got to read that plea.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, I know I got to read the plea. That's what I was trying to do last night when you put me up to all this.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.," No, I didn't."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," Yes, you did."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B., I told you to walk away. I told you to give a fake name.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," I did. Thanks very much. I'm Chareth Cutestory, a pirate lawyer. It was airtight."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.," Boy, you really had to work hard to bag this blind girl, huh?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," I certainly can't take advantage of her now, knowing what I know."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.," What? No, Michael, you can. Don't you...? You just won the gold medal at the sexual Special Olympics. She can't ever find you again. Don't you see that you're so lucky? God, how do you not...?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, What's the matter with you? Didn't you bag some woman that you're never going to see again?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.," Well, I screwed up. I kind of broke a couple of my own rules last night. I... She knows that I'm G.O.B. Bluth, and... we got married."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, What?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.," Well, she was a darer. She's one of those girls who just dares you to do things."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, You married her?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B., I needed a dare!
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator," What had started as an innocent flirtation had turned into a series of escalating challenges. Unfortunately, the evening was draining and the one thing they never dared each other to do was consummate the marriage."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B., Time to seal the deal.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.'s wife," Oh, wait, what time is it? Oh, God, seal the deal. My seal deal. I got to get to Sea Land. I'm selling five of their sickest seals to a third world zoo."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B., Did you say seals?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.'s wife," Yes, I told you, like, four hours ago, I sell seals! God, you ever listen to what I say?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B., I'm sorry I don't memorize every single word that comes out of your mouth-sometimes I just like to think. Think my thoughts.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.'s wife," Oh, we'll talk about this when I get home."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B., It was hot.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, The lengths you'll go to sleep with a woman.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.," Believe me, we didn't do any sleeping. I had sex last night."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator, But he really didn't.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.," Yes, I did."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator," And later, Michael arrived for his date."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie, Hey...
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, So sorry that I'm late.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie, I thought I smelled you coming.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," Yeah, here I am."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie," I thought so. Did you smell him? Did you smell the handsome man, Justice?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, Handsome. You don't have any evidence of handsome.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie," Well, that's true, but I can feel handsome. That feels handsomey."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, All right.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie, So you didn't get a case of I-just-had-a-one-night-stand-with-a-blind-girl-itis?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," No, of course not, one-night stand. Please. This is our second date now and want... And I want to see you again tonight, so, um... if it's a one-night stand I'm not very good at it."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie," But, now, listen, aren't you busy with the trial?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," Um... yes, of course, I'm very, very busy. But not too busy for you. Not too busy for a little walk right now, maybe, you and me. I'll be your seeing-eye dog. What do you think?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie, Oh!
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, Okay?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie, Should we leave Justice here?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," Um... yes, he'll be fine. Won't you boy? Huh?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie," Justice, stay. Stay. Described this to me, Chareth. Describe to me how beautiful the park is."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," Oh, I wish you could see it. It's just beautiful. An elderly couple, walking hand in hand. They're having a wonderful time. ""Already served, not to exceed six years, but no less than three."" Uh, three years is what I give them, and then one of them dies and the other one is not too far behind him."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie," I can smell right through you, Chareth. You're reading."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Rollerblader, Leash your dog!
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, Uh... Yes.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator," And George, Sr. was working on a roadside beautification effort brokered by Warden Stefan Gentles."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Warden Gentiles," Inmate, please."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr."," Yes, sir?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Warden Gentiles, I want you to know that last night I watched a very impressive video tape of the title Caged Wisdom. I was struck by the duel life of the spiritual man. I did very much enjoy the blooper bonus footage at the end.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr."," Oh, you know, I almost did strangle myself on my own prayer shawl."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Warden Gentiles, A self-choking for the ages.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr.", Thank you.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Warden Gentiles, There's a Shasta can there you seem to have missed.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr."," Okay. Thank you, warden."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator," Moments later, Cindi arrived."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Cindi Lightballoon," George! I had to see you. I'm sorry I left before. I just felt so awful, but I kept thinking about us. About our future."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr."," Yes, I..."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Cindi Lightballoon, And I know for a fact we can have one.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr."," Okay. Whatever this is they have on me. You keep talking about a fact. You keep saying ""I know for a fact."" What fact?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Cindi Lightballoon, Faith. I have faith my prayers will free you.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr.", Faith is not a fact.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Cindi Lightballoon," Oh, yes it is. You said so yourself in Caged Wisdom."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator," George, Sr. had said faith is a fact. Unfortunately, it was in the Caged Wisdom blooper bonus footage."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr."," Faith is a fact. No, faith is a facet. I almost said faith is a fact."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr.", I am going to trial because you don't understand what a blooper reel is? Guard!
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator," And back at the high school, George Michael ran into Maeby."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maeby," I got an A, check it out. Great job. Take some more money. I got to go. I'm going to this fund-raiser for a sick girl, okay?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator," This rang false to George Michael who knew that fund-raisers, a passion of her mother's, were something that Maeby would avoid. And later at the courthouse..."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, Good afternoon.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry," My God, so did you read the plea? We've got minutes here, not hours."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," I did read it, most of it. Um, I definitely, definitely read this-this first part of this first, uh, section, uh... No, did not read it."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.," Oh, come on, Michael. How many times are you going to screw up before the rest of this family sees you as the screwup that you are."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," Hey, I'm not the lawyer. Why didn't you read it?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry," Excuse me, I got busy with my other clients."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, What other clients?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry, He doesn't know about the divorce?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B., It's an annulment.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry," Oh, I looked into that, too. You can only get an annulment if you haven't consummated the marriage first."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.," Well, I guess I'll just stay married then, because we all know that I closed that deal, right?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator, But he really didn't.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Lucille, He was talking about my divorce.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, Your what?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B., You and Dad are getting divorced?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Lucille," Oh, don't worry, sweetie, no one is fighting over you. And don't worry about Barry reading the plea. We'll let your father rot in prison."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr.", Take the plea. We're taking the plea.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Lucille," We're going to trial. You're going to lose, and you're going to stay in there."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," That's enough, Mom."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Lucille, For him? Nothing's enough. You'd think a man locked up in prison would able to abstain. Your father with his disgusting tweaking. I couldn't breast feed any of you kids because of that man.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,All, Ahh!
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry, They still look fabulous.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr."," For God's sake, she was a government informant. This only thing I was pumping her for was information, honey."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," An informant, Dad? Are you crazy? You're going to blow this whole case."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr."," It's blown. It's over. It's dead. Take the plea, get me out there."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry, Let's take the plea. It's so nice and thick.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Lucille," Oh, George, I should have never doubted you. Even when you slept with my sister it was for a good reason."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr."," Got you to stop drinking, didn't it?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," All right, listen, this is all getting a little crazy. We cannot accept their conditions if we don't even know what their conditions are."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry, Do you want to read it?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," No, it is thick. Why don't we just take it."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry, I could kiss you on the [bleep].
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," Yeah, well-what?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator, And so the family gathered in the courtroom to announce their decision.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Bailiff #2, All rise! The court is now in session. The Honorable Lionel Ping presiding.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry," Oh, we've got Ping again."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Judge Ping, Please be seated. The prosecution has offered a plea?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie," We have, Your Honor."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry, We got Lizer!
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator," Yes, Maggie was the most feared prosecutor in all of Orange County."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie, And therefore I would like to bring your attention to Exhibit A.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator," Not because she was a particularly adept lawyer, but because she won the sympathy not only of the jury and the judge..."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie," And was that man in the room not you, Doctor?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator, But oftentimes the defendants themselves.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Doctor, I... I was in that room.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Judge Ping, Is the defense ready to respond?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry, What are you hiding from?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," (Whispering.) You got to call this off, okay? You got to get some more time. Get more time; she can smell me. She smells everything."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry, Objection.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Judge Ping, What?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry," We haven't read it. It's very long, Your Honor."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,"George, Sr.", (Whispers.) Sit down.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry, We haven't read it. We're going to get to-I'm going to start right now.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B., That's the blind chick you slept with?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry," Michael, you're in bed with the prosecution?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B., It's genius. We can get all the information we need.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry, Wait a minute. How will we know it's not a trap? Maybe she's setting you up.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," It's not a setup, okay. She gave me her real name. She said that she was a lawyer. I'm the one that lied to her. I got to go talk to her."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.," No. Michael, you can save this family. Please, do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that Dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry, The solution to all our problems is staring you right in the face and it can't even see you.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, I got to go talk to her.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.," Yeah, I better get back to the wife."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Barry, I think I'm going to take a scenic drive down to the City of Industry.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator, And George Michael went to the fund-raiser for the sick student Maeby had mentioned. But was surprised not to see Maeby there.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Teacher," We have in our midst a child who has shown us the meaning of courage. Now, let's show her the meaning of charity. Please welcome Surely Fünke."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator, And that's when George Michael realized Maeby had been making money by pretending to be two twin girls.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,George Michael, Maeby?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator, One of whom was ill.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Student, Somebody get her a cupcake.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator, And Michael went to Maggie's determined to tell her the truth.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie, What a surprise? Come on in.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," Hey, I'm in."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie," Hello, sorry. Hey, I thought you were going to be my reader."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," Oh, yeah. Oh, you're working, huh?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie, Yeah. Got a break. I wasn't prepared. Thanks to you. What about you? Don't tell me another pirate is still roaming the high seas.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," Uh, hey, you know, let's make a deal. You don't have to do this anymore 'cause I'm going to start laughing out loud."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie," Okay, that's going to help me so much."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," All right, let's go sit down. So, uh, Maggie, I... (clears throat) am not trying a case."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie, That's fantastic; they settled.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, Well...
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie," Great. Listen, I know I shouldn't do this, but... but I am so behind. I really do feel that I can trust you."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, Yeah? What is this?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie," Well, you ought to know. You can see."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, Maggie. What is it? Seriously.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie," Well, basically, it's an overview of the government's case against the Bluth family. It's a summary. Absolutely everything we've got."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael, And you're just going to give it to me.
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Maggie," You're a lawyer, what do you think? Do we have a case?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Michael," (Mouths words.) Oh, my God!"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, Maeby attempts to deposit her check, ... ... G.O.B. adapts to married life ..."
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.'s wife, Unbelievable. The seal deal fell through. Three of the seals died on their way to Chad. How am I ever going to find a maritime lawyer?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.," I'm sorry, did you say seals?"
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B.'s wife, Yes. I trade trained seals for a living. Do you ever listen?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,G.O.B., Do you ever stop talking?
1,Altar Egos,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Altar_Egos,Narrator," ... and Tobias is sent to sneak into Maggie's house to steal evidence, only to discover that she's not blind."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," Against his better judgment, Michael had recently set out to have an uncomplicated one-night stand with this woman."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," And, at his brother's suggestion, he gave a false identity."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, What's your name?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, Chareth Cutestory.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator, And what started as a night of passion with no strings attached got complicated the next morning when Michael found out she was blind. He decided to keep seeing her so as not to appear superficial.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," If it's a one-night stand, I'm not very good at it."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, Wow. But aren't you busy with the trial and everything?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," Unfortunately, the woman also turned out to be his father's prosecutor. And so Michael went to Maggie's to reveal his identity. But, before he could..."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, It's an overview of the government's case against the Bluth family. What do you think? Do we have a case?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," Meanwhile, Michael's son George Michael discovered that his cousin Maeby had been living a double life."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George Michael," Maeby, what are you doing? I still don't get why you're pretending to be two people, and why is one of you sick?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maeby," Hey, you don't get giant checks if you're healthy."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Teacher, Please welcome Surely Fünke!
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maeby," Plus, who's going to get mad at the dying girl?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George Michael, Surely's dying?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maeby, I figure I'll kill her off just before graduation just so everyone gets really sad before prom.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George Michael," Maeby, someone's going to get hurt. Not to mention it's kind of disrespectful for kids who actually have this."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maeby, Not a lot of kids have B.S. these days.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George Michael, What does that stand for?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maeby, I don't know. It's B.S.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator, Michael wrestled with the dilemma of whether he should look at the evidence file of the case against his father.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B., Michael.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," Hey, G.O.B. What the hell are you wearing?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B.," What? Oh, no, this is... The wife likes me in bright sweaters."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," G.O.B., in a series of escalating dares, recently got married to a woman be had only known for an evening."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, Your wife? She's still your wife?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B.," Well, I went to break up with her last night, but my timing was not great. So I think we should talk."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B.'s wife, My parents are getting a divorce. (Sobbing.) Why aren't you wearing that sweater I bought you? What? You don't like it?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B.," No, of course I like it, Just because I like it doesn't mean I have to wear it. I don't wear everything I like every day."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B.'s wife, Why don't we just get a divorce?! Everybody else is.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B., No! We're not getting divorced!
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B.," She really wants to stay together, so..."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," Well, at least you finally consummated it, huh?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B., Consummated... What is up with that prosecutie? I hope you didn't break up with her.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," No, I didn't. And, to make matters worse, she gave me this. It's a summary of the evidence that they have against Dad."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B.," Okay, Michael, this makes matters better. Let's just destroy it and move on with our lives."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," This is not the actual evidence. It's just a list of the evidence. And, judging by the amount of boxes she has in her place, I have a feeling there's a lot of it."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B.," A feeling? Oh, don't tell me you won't open it on ethical grounds."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, I'm not sure what I'm going to do.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B., What is with the insane moral code in this family?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Lindsay," Yes! We did it! We're getting rid of the Ten Commandments. You know, the granite ones in front of the courthouse. You know, all it took was the threat of a lawsuit."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, You're involved with those protesters now? When did that happen?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Lindsay," Oh, who can remember?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," Lindsay's involvement began hours before when, leaving the plea hearing, she first determined the Ten Commandments didn't belong there."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Lindsay, They won't even allow me one lousy cigarette! Oh!
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Lucille," Honey, they're just heels. They can only support so much weight."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Lindsay, I've always been very passionate about the separation of church and state.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, What are you going to do with them?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Lindsay," Oh, I don't know. Give them to a school."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, Could we let another family bring down the Ten Commandments? This family's already done more than its share.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B.," Oh, now you love the Ten Commandments. And yet you're the one who so conveniently forgot ""Thou shalt protect thy father, and honor no one above him unless it beith me-thy sweet Lord."""
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," I'm not sure that one made it down the mountain, G.O.B."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George Michael, I told you someone would get hurt.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maeby," Yeah, if I knew it was going to be you, I wouldn't have been so worried."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," Hey, what happened to you?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maeby," He was trying to help some handicapped girl up to the bleachers, and he fell."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George Michael," It's just a sprain, but at least it's legitimate."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Tobias, Ah... the clumsy adolescent. It's a phase we've all been through. Except for me. I was like a cat. I always ended up on all fours. (Long pause.) Like a cat.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Lindsay, Wait a minute. They don't have ramps at your school?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George Michael," Well, not up the bleachers."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Lindsay," You should threaten to sue. It's free if it's just a threat, you know."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maeby," Hey, that's a good idea."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," All right, no one's going to sue anybody. I'm not going to have my son start abusing the legal system like the rest of this family. After all, we're going to need it for years to come."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator, And that's when Michael decided to do the right thing.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, So what do you think? Do we have a case against this idiot family or what?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," Well, that's... that's actually why I wanted to talk to you, Maggie. You see, it turns out that... that I am actually one of those idiots. I might even be the main idiot. Well, I'm not the main idiot, but I am the idiot in charge. I'm Michael Bluth. Okay? And I want you to know that I... I never opened up this folder. And, if... if you could see my face, you'd see how sorry I am that I lied to you."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie," You feel sincere. Damn it! I have spent the last five hours hating you, ever since I found out you were Michael Bluth in court."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, What? How did you even know?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie," I'm blind, Michael. Not stuffed up."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, You smelled me.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie," I smelled you, baby."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," Maggie, why... why didn't you tell me at your house? And why did you give me this folder?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, I was manipulating you. This isn't a real list. This is a wish list.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, I can't believe you set me up.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, You lied to me. Chareth Cutestory?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," I know. ""Thou shalt not make up a name in vain,"" but, you know, I walked into that court, and I saw you there, and this... this can't happen, right?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, You're damn right this can't happen. Look at me. This could get me... Are you actually looking at me?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," Yes, I am."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, Okay. I could get disbarred for this. And your dad would have to spend tons more time in prison. I got to tell you something. The thing that really gets to me is I keep hearing that Michael Bluth is so (bleep)ing cute.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," Well, I know Maggie Lizer is... adorable. You don't know what you're missing."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, Really?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, Really. So what are we going to do?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, I guess we're just going to have to go our separate ways and agree to never speak about this again.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," That is probably best, huh?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, The least you could do is buy me a drink.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, Yeah. I'll stay for one drink.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," The next morning, Michael, once again, found himself at Maggie's. And, once again, berated himself for the mistake."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," Oh, no! I'm supposed to be at the prison to talk to my dad in a half an hour."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, I can't believe we did this again.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, It was so stupid.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, Incredibly stupid. It's like we're making naughty sex even naughtier.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," Oh, no! I was supposed to be at the prison to talk to my dad a half an hour ago."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, This is bad. This is really bad. This is the second most unethical thing I've ever done.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," We cannot pretend that this didn't happen, Maggie."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, Or that it won't happen again.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, Do you think it's going to happen again?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, You tell me.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, Let's just assume that it will happen again. Sometime.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, Right. Right.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, What we should do is acknowledge this and... and keep it private. And I don't think that there's anything wrong with that.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie," Right. I mean, I have a job, you know? I'm trying to keep a man in prison."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, And that man happens to be my father. This could get ugly.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie," Well, it's like the Ten Commandments say, you know? ""Be true to thine own self, and to thine own self..."""
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," ""...be true."" Yeah. Number seven."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, We'll just have to keep it a secret.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, Our secret.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, Our dirty little secret.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, I think I'm ready now.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, All right.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," 32 minutes earlier, G.O.B., Lucille and Barry met with George Sr."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George, Where did you get this?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B., They don't call me a sleight-of-hand artist for nothing.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator, G.O.B. had switched out the file while his siblings discussed the Ten Commandments.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Lindsay, I've always been very passionate about the separation of church and state.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, What are you going to do with them?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Lindsay," Oh, I don't know. Give them to a school."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, Could we let another family bring down the Ten Commandments? This family's already done more than its share.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B.," Oh, now you love the Ten Commandments. Apparently, there are boxes of it at the prosecutor's house. I tracked down the address, and you should be thanking me for this. Michael didn't want you to have it. ""Mr. Moral."""
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George," Yeah. We did something right there, huh?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Lucille," So, what do you think, Barry?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Barry, I... I haven't read it. I had a really interesting date last night-a woman who actually works two jobs.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Lucille," Well, it certainly looks like they've got a lot on us... uh... you. I was raising the children."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B., When was the last time you raised children?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Lucille, Excuse me. I've got two in the waiting room right this moment.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," In fact, Buster and Annyong, Lucille's newly-adopted Korean child, were waiting."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Buster, Wow. I wonder what they're talking about in there.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Annyong," They don't tell you anything, huh?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Buster," They tell me things. It doesn't matter, though, because Dad is going to be in here a long time."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Annyong," No. We have court date today. They take plea, Daddy come home. You out."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," Annyong had hit a nerve. And Buster recalled that, right before George Sr.'s arrest, he'd made a similar threat."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Lucille, I said he could wear that tie. It looks better on him.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George," No, no. Let me help you with that, son. Hey, enjoy yourself tonight because you are out of here. I'm not going to spend my retirement watching you wipe your nose on your sleeve."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Buster," I can't breathe, Dad."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George, Neither can I.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George," I haven't seen half of this stuff. If they've got these kind of documents, we've gotta get rid of this."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Barry," If you're thinking of stealing the evidence, that is a very big offense. I... I think I'm going to say that I signed myself out about ten minutes ago."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George, You're right. You can't afford to get caught. I don't need my lawyer in prison. We'll have G.O.B. break in.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B.," Well... gee, Dad, I... I've got a wife now. I don't think that I can afford to get caught either."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George, Good point. You might want to change out of that sweater.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, Tell me again why this isn't wrong.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," All right, look, we're just... we're two adults. We've got absolutely nothing... cops! Hide."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Officer Kelley, Ms. Lizer. It's Officer Kelley.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie," Oh, hi."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Officer Kelley, Your office has asked me to come pick you up. It's a surprise. I just winked. It's a surprise witness.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie," Oh, great."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, How we doing?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, I'll just put my dog inside and then I will be right with you.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Officer Kelley, Okay.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, I'll take the dog. I've already missed my meeting. You go ahead.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie," You just put him through the doggie door, okay and, uh, I'll see you in court."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," Yeah, my dad's not going to put himself in prison for life, right? Kiss."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, Oh.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator, G.O.B. decided to pass off his break-in assignment to Tobias.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B.," Hey, there's the cat. Sorry you couldn't have been down at the prison with us. Dad was asking all about you."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Tobias," Oh, I doubt that very much."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B.," Look, I'm not going to lie to you. He feels like you've been sucking off this family for far too long and if you don't start pulling your weight around here, it's going to be shape up or ship up."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Tobias," You know, try as I might, I cannot seem to impress that man."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B., Isn't that funny? I'm about to knock his socks off again. I'm about to break into this house that's got a bunch of evidence in it. Just to borrow it... insure his freedom forever. But it's a tough job. Requires agility.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Tobias, This kind of agility?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B.," Let's go, little man."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," Michael, meanwhile, decided to see what life in Maggie's world was like."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, All right... okay. All right... okay. Okay.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Officer Kelley, This guy's the real deal. He's on the inside. But he's got some demands.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, This could be the break we wanted.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Officer Kelley, This is District Attorney Lizer.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, All right.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Buster," Uh, I want immunity for me and my mom and I want my Dad to stay in prison. Also can you send Annyong back to Korea?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, Huh?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, Justice... hey... hey!
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," Meanwhile, Maggie's interrogation of Buster was proving fruitless."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, Do you know anything about your father's trips overseas?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Buster, I knew I'd have a fun time at home alone with Mom.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, Fine. Did you ever see him return from these trips with anything unusual?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Buster, He once came back once with a black statue with an erect penis. It stayed in our living room until my aunt objected.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, What about business associates?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Buster, I have none.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie," All right, this guy's wasting our time. Take away his grilled cheese."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Buster," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait! If it's evidence you want, I know where they keep it. According to my brother, there are boxes of evidence in a house on Scenic View Drive."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Officer Kelley, Isn't that where you live?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, Yeah. And I'm headed there now.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," Tobias, meanwhile, had used his cat-like agility to get the evidence at Maggie's house."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Tobias, The cat is in.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," Unfortunately, it was just as Maggie came home."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, Is there someone here?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," Tobias, concerned about Maggie's heightened sense of smell, set off to cloak himself in her scent. And Michael was at the vet's office."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Veterinarian, Justice is fine.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, Great!
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Veterinarian," Although, dressing him up like a seeing eye dog seems a little cruel."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, Cruel?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Veterinarian," Well, yeah, because he can't see."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, What are you talking about?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Veterinarian," Mr. Bluth, Justice is blind."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," Justice cannot be blind, Doc. He's got a handle and everything. Come on, boy. Maybe his peripheral isn't great, but he's been leading a blind woman around."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Veterinarian, I think she's been leading him around.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, But that would mean that-that Maggie isn't blind.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," In fact, Maggie wasn't blind, but had been pretending to be since she found it helpful in taking the LSATs."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Proctor," or ""D"" B places fourth."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie," ""A""?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," Finding it a tremendous boon to her professional life, Maggie continued the ruse."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, I submit into evidence this wine glass with the defendant's fingerprints.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Judge, Don't worry. You're so ahead.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," Her ability to see, however, was currently proving a disadvantage as she couldn't reveal to the man she recognized as Tobias that she knew he was there without betraying her secret. And Tobias was finding her an uncannily difficult blind girl to outmaneuver. Their game of cat and mouse continued... until Michael showed up to return Justice."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie," Oh, Justice, what is it, boy? What is it? Is there some jackass in my bathrobe? Oh! I can't see!"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," And later, the family gathered at the courthouse to respond to the plea offer."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,G.O.B., They don't have a case against us. I took care of everything.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Barry, Something smells wonderful.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Tobias," Well, thank you. Would that I could say that I wore it to impress you, but, no, I'm afraid it's merely a cloaking agent from a sadly blunderous afternoon."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George," Who else have we got? What about Buster? Worst case scenario, he gets caught... no more Buster."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Buster, I'm not going anywhere. You're the one who's staying put. Not me. You.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Lucille, What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," Outside the courthouse, Surely Fünke was addressing the crowd. George Michael prepared to confront her about it."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maeby," Not just to me, but to all handicapped kids out there who are sick and tired of sitting in the front rows at basketball games."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," George Michael spotted his father, and not wanting to appear to be abusing the legal system, found a place to hide. Michael, determined to expose Maggie, hid to avoid tipping his hand. It was then, however, that Lindsay's advocacy group had their big moment."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," Hey, George Michael, what are you doing here?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George Michael, I just thought I'd come down and see the family. See everyone.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," Oh, really? Well, pal, you don't need to do that. You can head on home. Why don't you go help that handicapped friend of yours?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George Michael, She kind of lied to me.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," I was recently lied to myself, and for what it's worth, George Michael, you cannot let people get away with that."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George Michael, It's just so hard to know what the right thing to do is.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," I know, it's not like there's some list of rules handed down to us from on high. Watch your head."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator, So Michael set out to expose in court that Maggie wasn't really blind.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Barry, She's right there. What are we going to do?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, I got a plan.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Barry, Thank God.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," Your Honor, the purpose of a court of law is to find the truth, which is why witnesses swear on this. After all, they say justice is blind. Surely, she has enough sight to catch the truth before it hits her in the face."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie," Objection, Your..."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," Unfortunately, Maggie had been temporarily blinded that day."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, I can't see!
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Judge Ping, Bailiff!
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," That was my plan, what do you got?"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," So, George Michael decided to once and for all put an end to Surely Fünke."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George Michael, I need to talk to you.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maeby, And this is the man who inspired me. George Michael Bluth.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maeby," He is the one who is responsible for the new ramps at our school, and he will carry on my legacy, and put an end to B.S.!"
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,George Michael, Surely can beat this thing!
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,All, No more B.S.! No more B.S.!
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," And Michael reunited with Maggie, who'd been kicked off the case."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, I really thought you were lying to me. I'm so sorry.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie," Michael, I've been doing this blind act thing for years. It's whacked."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, Are you going to admit that you were faking it?
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie," I think I'm going to go for, ""I was struck by the Bible and it restored my sight."" So what about us? We were starting to establish some trust. Except for all the lies."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael, I was originally looking for something completely uncomplicated.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie," Yeah, me, too. Forget it, this is so over."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Michael," You know, we're saying good-bye and this is actually the first time that I feel that you can really see me."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie, Yeah. Just two people staring at each other fully exposed in a court of law.
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Maggie," Come on, Justice."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, Barry gets a sign from God ..."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Barry," I will obey your will. I will lead a good life. Well, to hell with this then."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Narrator," ... and Maggie is replaced with a new, less generous prosecutor."
1,Justice Is Blind,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Justice_Is_Blind,Buster, I was made to understand there were grilled cheese sandwiches here.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,John Beard, The local colleges are on spring break and things are heating up in Newport Beach.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator, George Michael was off from school for two weeks and was enjoying spending time with his uncle.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B., I'm intercepting some telepathic energy. It's telling me it's the... eight of diamonds.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael, That's amazingly close.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," Gee, I got it wrong. Well, I guess you won the shirt off my back."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," Okay, that's amazing."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B., It's the queen of diamonds.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," No, no, but, I mean, if that had been the actual card, I'm pretty sure I'd be almost too blown away."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," It's a, you know, it's a new trick. I'm still tweaking my nipple thing."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael, Your presentation is great.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," Whoa! What's going on here, huh? George Michael, you should get to school."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," No, we're off for two weeks, Dad. G.O.B.'s teaching me some new tricks."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B., Spring break. It's my favorite holiday. Nothing gets me more excited.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, I can see that. You might want to button that shirt up.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," No, I'm good. Anyway, listen. Michael, um... I need the yacht. Kinda made a commitment."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," One year earlier, G.O.B. had appeared on a youth-oriented music network when they did a segment on Spring Break Newport Beach."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," Now that I've gotten your attention, I'd like to announce that one year from today, I shall make that beautiful yacht... disappear."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael, Wow. He's amazing.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," Yeah, well, he hasn't done it and you're holding a four of spades in your hand."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," Yeah. I don't care. I'm loving the ride, you know? (To G.O.B.) So how you going to do it?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," Well, you've got two weeks off. You're about to find out."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B., Maybe we'll meet a couple of young coeds along the way. How young is too young for you?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," Okay, that's not going to happen. Okay? There's not gonna be any coeds. There certainly isn't going to be any magic. It is a path to a lonely life where people mock you and you don't even realize it."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," But Michael, I'm a magici... Oh, I see what you did."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, You're not dressed yet? I thought you were working for me today in the office.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay," Oh, you guys stay open during spring break?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," Well, we're not Orthodox."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," But don't worry about it. Kitty's coming back, and it's just in time. She's caused nothing but problems since she's worked for me."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, Kitty! Isn't that your phone?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty," No, I'm on the phone with your dad. That one's your line."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," Kitty, these are not the files I asked for."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty," Oh, then I don't know what I shredded."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, Have you had a chance to type up that report yet?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty," No, I have been Googling your father."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, So I've heard.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," She's been out for two weeks with this chest thing, but she's had no problems cashing the checks I've been sending her."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay," Speaking of which, have we gotten anything from Nana?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," Buster got a perforated heart and G.O.B. got that receding hairline, but you and I pretty much dodged the bullet."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay," No, I meant in the mail. She usually sends checks for Maeby's birthday."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Maeby, There's been cash coming in? Have you been holding out on me?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay," No, No, I've been investing it. Let's face it- I'm better with money than you are."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Maeby, Better at spending it.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay," Okay, I tell you what. I'll take you down to see Nana if you split the money with me 60-40."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Maeby, 55-55.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay, Deal.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, Sounds like you guys are getting more than you think.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay," We should go now before your dad gets back. No need going halfsies with him, too."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Maeby, Right.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," In fact, Tobias had gone to prison to research the role of Frightened Inmate #2 for a film. This came at a bad time for George, Sr., who was in a conflict with a prisoner named White Power Bill, a conflict Tobias inadvertently helped him solve."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr.", I sold you for a pack of cigarettes.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Warden Gentiles, But didn't you come here to research the nature of fear? I can't think of any better teacher than White Power Bill. He's like a masters course unto himself.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Tobias, So you think I'm a coward?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Warden Gentiles," There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle-Murray. No, what I'm calling you... is a television actor."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Tobias, Ouch.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator, And so Tobias remained in prison as Lindsay and Maeby arrived at Nana's.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay," Now, remember, she's a very old woman. We're going to get in, get the cash and get out."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Old Woman, Is this who I think it is?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay and Maeby, Nana!
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," Unfortunately, the woman who now lived there was not their Nana, a fact that took Lindsay and Maeby an hour and a half to ascertain."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay, Go! Go! It's not her. Drop the photo album. We're not in the photo album.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Maeby, Drop the pie!
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator, Michael arrived at work to find Kitty.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, Hey. Kitty. How are you feeling?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty," Much better. Man, I was really stuffed up, there. Up here, Michael. Up here."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, Why'd you have to get sick now? What was the rush?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," In fact, it was the previous year's spring break that was responsible for Kitty's rush when the makers of the popular video series Girls with Low Self-Esteem chose not to include her."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Cameraman," Okay, we got all the good stuff here."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty, Let's just say I'm looking forward to a more successful spring break.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, Break? You were just out.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty, That was my sick leave. This is vacation.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," No, no, you're not going on vacation."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty," Oh, yes, I absolutely am. If you need me, I will be at Señor Tadpole's having a margarita made in my mouth."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," No, no, hey, Kitty. There will be no margarita in your mouth."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty," Oh, yes, there absolutely will be a margarita in my mouth. Spring break, whoo-hoo! Up here, Michael. Up here."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," Put the shirt back down and keep on moving, okay? You're fired."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty, I work for your father. You don't have the hiring and firing power.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," I absolutely do, and you're fired."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty," I don't think your father is gonna be very happy about this. So take a good look, 'cause it's the last time."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, That's like the seventh nipple I've seen today.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator, And Michael was called to the prison.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr."," What are you doing firing Kitty? You can't fire Kitty. First of all, you don't have hiring and firing power."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," I do, and I had to- she's crazy."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr."," Well, that's why you don't fire her. You don't fire crazy. You never fire crazy."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," She's completely unprofessional. Look, she just came back from sick leave with these... Oh, my God. You paid for them. Didn't you?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr."," Look, you got carried away. Hell, I-I've been, I've been so corrupted by my power that I even enjoyed firing my own twin brother. You should have seen his face when he was begging me not to. Well, he's my twin brother. I can show you. It's funny, but, you know, Kitty had access to all kinds of information. God knows what she poked her nose into."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr."," There's enough evidence on this boat to put me away. You're the only real thing I have. Oh, God, there's nothing to hold on to down there. You're like a boy."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty, What's wrong with you?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr.", All these books are cooked.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, I'm sorry. I gotta do my job.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr."," And I gotta get out of prison. Next time someone threatens me, I may not have a son-in-law to offer."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," Look, I can't come in here... Offer?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr."," I may not have a son-in-law to offer me counseling. You know, he should have stayed a shrink. He's very gifted, you know."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," In fact, Tobias had even produced a videotape, but its brief success was due to its misleading name. Once this was discovered, all but ten of the videos were returned."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr."," Hire Kitty back. Okay? For the company. No, no. For me."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, It is kind of a funny face.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr."," Oh, come on, now."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lucille," There's just absolutely no purse that will go with this outfit. You've got a little pocket there, Annyong."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Annyong, Annyong.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lucille, That's not getting old.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay, Where's Nana?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lucille," I sent her on a wonderful cruise. You just missed a wonderful call from her. She just came back from a wonderful costume party that the captain threw. She gained ten pounds, there's so much food on that boat. She's up to 74. It's wonderful. Just wonderful."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," In fact, Lucille's mother had been dead for six months."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lucille, She tried pesto for the first time. Can you believe that? 92 years old and she never tried pesto.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator, Lucille feared that the family would come after the inheritance if they found out.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay," Was she on the phone, Annyong?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Annyong, Annyong?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lucille, Emory board. Isn't he great? And he goes with everything.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," Meanwhile, G.O.B. was adjusting to a new companion of his own."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael, But that's not the end of the trick. There's a big surprise coming.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," Take your T-shirt off, please."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," Oh, you changed the trick. It's a different trick."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," Now, if I roll up this T-shirt... Put it in this hat..."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," G.O.B.! Hey, George Michael?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," Hang on, Dad, we're in the middle of something."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," And if you'll be so kind as to expose your breasts, please."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Hey! What the hell are you doing?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," Dad, it's misdirection. You're supposed to keep your eye on the shirt in the hat."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," Get downstairs, right now. Come on. Buddy, what are you doing here?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael, I'm dying to see how he makes this yacht disappear.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, He's not going to make the yacht disappear. I told him that.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," No, but it's driving me crazy. It's like a mind puzzle, an awesome mind puzzle."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator, Michael looked at his son and saw that he truly was inspired by his uncle. That perhaps the boy actually admired him.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, I gotta get you out of here. You're gonna come work with me at the office. Go wait in the stair car.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," (To G.O.B.) Hey, I want you to explain something to me. I'm out looking for Kitty and I find my son in the middle of a Girls with Low Self-Esteem video."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," Oh, don't worry, he's going to be covered with a blue dot. Look, he approached me. And as for Kitty, I think you're crazy that to have fired her. Who knows what kind of information she has?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," He's my brother and he's never even said ""good job."" I just want him to love me, you know?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty," Wow, you get really girly after, huh?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," Yeah, she definitely knows way too much. Well, go get her. It's the holidays. I'm sure she's down at Señor Tadpole's."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," Right. Having a cocktail made in her mouth. All right, I'm going to go take care of that. In the meantime, stay away from my son."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," Wow, Michael, I'm really hurt. It's family. What's more important than family, Michael? This yacht?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," Of course not, G.O.B."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," You'd make the deal? Right now. I stay away from your son, you let me use the yacht."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, The holidays really bring out the best in you.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B., Well...
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," Meanwhile, Tobias found his experience as a therapist was helping him deal with his new cellmate."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Tobias," Yes, but where does the hate come from, Bill? What causes it?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,White Power Bill," The Jews, I guess."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Tobias,"00 pounding"" you promised me. I'm going to take a shot at something and say that I think you hate... White Power Bill."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,White Power Bill, I hate you.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Tobias, You hate White Power Bill.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,White Power Bill, I hate the government.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Tobias, You hate White Power Bill.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,White Power Bill, I hate my father!
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Warden Gentiles," (Over P.A.) Recreation. All prisoners, one hour."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Tobias, Go get 'em.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,White Power Bill, I hate White Power Bill.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Little Justice, You killed him.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Tobias," Well, I..."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Little Justice, Like Dorothy. The Wicked Witch is dead! All hail Dorothy!
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," And at an elegant restaurant, Michael asked Kitty to come back."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty," Who are you asking back, Michael, me... or these?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," I want you all back. I want the whole gang, okay? Please, Kitty? I'm trying real hard here, you know? Could we just make believe that none of this ever happened and just start fresh?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty," Oh, Michael, of course, I'll come back 'cause I never really left. Because we both know that you can't fire people."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," No, I did fire you and now I'm hiring you back."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty, You don't have authority over me. They don't have nachos here.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," You know what, Kitty? Why don't we forget it. 'Cause I've been trying to be very, very generous to you and you don't respect me, so I'm firing you, okay? You are fired."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty," All right, Michael. But I know where things are and you don't and you are asking for a whole world of trouble."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," If you're threatening me, you're going to be very sorry."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty, Are you threatening me?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," Yeah, that's a threat. I'm threatening you!"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty, Did you hear that everyone? Michael Bluth is threatening me!
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,John Beard, I've got to get out of here. I'm part of the story. I can't be a part of the story. I can't be a part of the story.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty," Say good-bye to your company, Michael. And say good-bye..."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," No, no, no, no."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Kitty, ...to these 'cause it's the last time!
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,John Beard, A woman shows all during a fracas at a local restaurant... sources say.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator, George Michael was working harder than ever over his spring break filling in for the now twice-fired Kitty.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," Look at us working together. You get the hang of this, and this could be your summer."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," Well, I don't know, Dad. I really wanted to see G.O.B.'s magic show and..."

1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," Good afternoon, Bluth Company. Talk you off? Talk you off of what, Pop-Pop?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr."," George Michael... Oh. Hey, I thought you were... When's that voice going to drop? Where's Kitty?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael, I think Dad fired her again. He wants to talk to you.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," Well, I don't want to talk to him. I made my decision and that's that."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," You heard? Yeah, all right."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, What'd he say?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," Well, if I clean it up, it's not really a sentence."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator, And so George Sr. made another call.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr."," Kitty's on the loose. I need you to make something disappear for me. Just some books in that cooler marked ""Maddas."" Great."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," George Sr. hung up, confident that his problems would finally be taken care of."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr."," Hey, Little Justice. You painted your shoes red."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Little Justice, Call me the Tin Man. I'm a friend of Dorothy's now. And she wants to see you.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," And back at the office, Lindsay arrived with her daughter and her mounting suspicions."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay, Mom says she sent Nana on a cruise.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, You're still on this? How much was in those birthday cards?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay," It's not about the money, Michael. It's about Nana. I think Mom's sent her to a nursing home. Some gray windowless room, against her will."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," So, what was it like out there today?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Maeby, Nice. Sunny.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael, Wow.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Maeby, So how do you think G.O.B.'s going to make this yacht disappear?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," Well, I'll be working here, so I guess I'll never know."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Maeby, The only real way to find out how it's done is to sneak on the boat while he does it.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," Yeah, but then if he makes it disappear, won't everyone just see me standing there?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Maeby," Let's just sit quietly and consider how ridiculous that statement was. Anyway, if it was me, that's what I would do."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay," I want to check out Mom's financial activity. Call her banks, maybe run a hospital search."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," Well, it's going to mean a lot of hard work, but I'll put somebody on it. George Michael! Where's George Michael?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," In fact, at Maeby's suggestion, George Michael was off to visit his Uncle G.O.B.."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," Hey, Uncle G.O.B. I came by to see if you needed any help with your magic show."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B., Great.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael, I think it's so great that you're doing this.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B., I'm prepping right now.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael, So how'd you get my Dad's permission?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," Suddenly, G.O.B. remembered the promise he had made to stay away from Michael's son."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B., None of your damn business. Get the hell out of here.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael, What?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," You don't have the magic in you. You never did. You don't have it here. So take a good look. It's the last time you're going to see these. Sorry, kid, more than you'll..."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael, What?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B., Beat it!
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," As G.O.B. was forced to send away someone he loved, George Sr. was forced to visit someone he had once tried to shove out of moving car."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Tobias, Welcome.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr.", You're Dorothy?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Tobias, I thought the two of us could talk man-on-man. I'm afraid I'm serious. I bought you.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Tobias, (To Little Justice.) Remember to let it steam for five minutes.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr."," Oh, dear God."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Tobias, I've been in this family for 16 years and I don't think we've ever had a conversation.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr.", I'm not going to discuss this.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Tobias, You hate me.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr."," Yeah, I do hate you. You took my daughter, my precious little girl and moved her away, and now I'm here and I'm afraid I will never get her back."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Tobias," Afraid. You're afraid. Fear has turned into hate. So Frightened Inmate #2 isn't frightened at all. He's angry. He's a crabby old coot, and he needs love... just like everyone."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,"George, Sr.", Get your [bleep]ing hands off me.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Tobias, Shh. Don't be scared. (Singing.) / Somewhere over the rainbow / There's another rainbow... /
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," And on the beach, the show was beginning."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B., Any magician can make the queen of diamonds disappear. But what about a whole boat?!
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, Have you seen George Michael?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lucille, We just got here. I couldn't find my keys. I can never find anything in here.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," Where once there was a yacht, now there is naught!"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," All right, so how'd you do it?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," Michael, a magician never reveals his... I sunk it! I sunk the yacht! At least I think I sunk it. I mean, I blew it up and I don't see it anywhere. Oh, God, my heart was in my throat when that curtain came down and I'm looking out."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," You sank the yacht? You sank a $700,000 yacht?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B.," With $900,000 worth of insurance on it. And got rid of the evidence. How about a ""Good job""?!"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," Seeing a window of opportunity, Lucille made a startling announcement."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lucille, Nana was on that yacht!
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, What?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lucille, You killed Nana!
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay, She's lying. Nana wasn't on that yacht. She's fine. She's been dead for six months.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," Lindsay had learned this information when she spoke to the family's personal banker. Later, fearing that Lindsay was on to her, Lucille went to the bank herself."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lucille, There must be somewhere I can put this money where it can't be touched.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Bank Manager, I suppose you can keep it in your purse.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lucille, Very funny. But I'm not carrying a... purse.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay," Where's the money, Mom? I want the money."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lucille," Well, you can't have it. It's in a trust fund for Annyong..."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Annyong, Annyong?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lucille," ... and no one can touch it but me, and I retain control of it until he's 18."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," the fact you didn't tell us about our grandmother's death or that you sank a $700,000 yacht."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lucille, Stop lecturing me. I just lost my mother.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael," I'm so glad that George Michael wasn't here to see any of this. Maeby, where is George Michael?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Maeby," Um, well, if he's not here, I just have to say he's probably on the yacht."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, On the yacht?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," In fact, George Michael had boarded the yacht, but when he saw the evidence of G.O.B.'s lifestyle, he realized that this perhaps was not the life he wanted, while Kitty went in search of retribution in the form of the files in the cooler."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lindsay," Hey, George Michael's a good kid. I'm sure he's at the office."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, I told him to stay away from you and I told you to stay away from him.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,G.O.B., I tried to get rid of him. I told him to get out.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," Bluth Company, George Michael speaking, not Kitty."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, Thank God you're there.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," Yeah, well, I don't need a real spring break. I really think I am much better off here alone in this office."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," Michael realized he'd been too hard on his son, so he came up with a solution."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, You're fired.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael, Really? Can you fire people?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, Yeah. Go have a spring break.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,George Michael," Thanks, Dad. Are you sure you're going to be okay without Kitty?"
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, Don't you worry. She'll turn up.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, Lupe makes a startling discovery..."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Lupe," Oh, so that makes Annyong 18."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Narrator, ... and Michael finds himself in the middle of the search for a missing Kitty.
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Officer Taylor," Well, we have a restaurant full of people saying that you threatened Kitty the last time she was seen."
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Michael, How does anybody even remember this?
1,Missing Kitty,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Missing_Kitty,Officer Taylor," She showed her knobs in a steak house, sir."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Narrator," Michael was meeting with the company's accountant, Ira Gilligan."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Ira Gilligan," Anyway, I have gone over this ten different ways and you're reporting income on an account that... You know, it is just freezing in here."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," Well, the thermostat is in my office and while it's freezing in here, it's still hot in there. So, please continue."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Ira Gilligan, There's basically no money where it should be. I think I'm catching a cold.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael, You're not catching a cold.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Ira Gilligan, I know my body.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," So, there's no money in the account?"
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Ira Gilligan, Uh... I'm sorry. This is like the bayou in here.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," Well, I tried to tell you that."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Ira Gilligan," Well, I guess I just had to find out for myself. Anyway..."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Ira Gilligan," ...this isn't the first discrepancy with your father's books. And with this court case coming up, I just have to warn you, if they ask me to testify, I'm not going to lie."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael, No one's asking you to lie.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're asking Gilligan not to lie?"
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Ira Gilligan," Please, call me Ira. I don't like Gilligan."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B., Who doesn't like Gilligan? Is it cold in here?
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," So, listen, you've been married two weeks now. It seems to be sticking. Let's pretend it's a good thing. I guess this makes me your best man and I would like to throw you a bachelor party."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," (Laughs.) Yeah, I don't think she'd go for that. Besides, I talked to Dad. He said it was stupid to get married in the first place. And he's right. He's right and I've got to get rid of her."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," You know, I said two weeks ago that I thought it was a stupid idea. Suddenly, Dad says it and it's good advice? You know, you don't have to do everything Dad says."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," I don't do everything Dad says. He just happens to be right about this. You can help me get rid of her, though. Mom's having a cocktail party. She'll be there. You could try and break us up."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael, I can't do that.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," Why not? You did with me and Marta. You had no problem with that, guy. You know what? Lie to her. Tell her that I'm insensitive and unreliable."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael, Maybe something about how you can never confront people and you need someone else to clean up your messes.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," See, that's great... and that's just off the top of your head."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Tobias," Michael, G.O.B.... I was just in the neighborhood. Good Lord, it is sweltering in here."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Tobias," As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael, Really? When did that start?
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Tobias," Well, I don't want to blame it all on 9/11, but it certainly didn't help."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Tobias," But anyway, I need your help. If you could possibly... Can we go back to your office, please?"
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Tobias," I just want to be a family again. I guess what I'm saying is, I want to reunite the band."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," Oh, no."

1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael, Why don't you ask her?
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Tobias," Oh, I would, but she doesn't take me seriously."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Narrator, And Michael tried to find the money the accountant said was missing.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George," I don't know. I probably stole it. I mean, if he says it's missing, it is. Unless he stole it. Hey. Maybe he stole it."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael, He's the one who said it's missing.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George," Yeah, I probably stole it."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," Well, you need to find it before Ira is asked to testify."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George, I thought you were talking about Gilligan. Who's Ira?
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael, Ira Gilligan. Ira's his first name. He actually hates to be called Gilligan.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George," Well, he never told me that."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George, Gilligan has promised me that all this money will be safe in IRAs.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Ira Gilligan," It's Ira, sir."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George," Oh, I'm sorry, Gilligan. Will be safe in Ira's."

1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George, Fun. Guy fun. Let's get him on our side.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael, No. I'm not taking him fishing.

1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," Hm. Nah, he said it was the most fun your family's ever had."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Lindsay," Yeah, well, I was whacked on Zanotab the entire time."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael, I thought Zanotab was supposed to make everything a little bit better.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Lindsay," For 15 minutes, then it burns when you pee and your marriage goes to hell. It's not a good supplement. Besides, Maeby's not gonna want to do it."

1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Maeby," Look, I'm just doing this because if my parents split up, it's a lot more work for me.

1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Tobias, I smell olives.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Narrator," And Michael, as per G.O.B.'s request, tried to convince his wife that G.O.B. was unreliable."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," So, G.O.B. is late, but I guess that's who you married. He's probably out trying to do something very important."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.’s wife, Are you hitting on me? G.O.B. said that would happen.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," Hey, G.O.B., it's a good thing you're not staying married to this girl. You've got her hating me- at least your version of me, which is actually you."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," I talked to Dad, and he thinks that I should stay in it."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," Stay in the marriage? Oh, come on, you're not letting Dad lead you around by the nose again, are you?"
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," Think about it. I've got the marriage and none of the good parts. It's like so far it's been all chain and no ball. So, we'll have a ceremony and bachelor party."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael, A bachelor party? You want one now? Come on. You're not giving your best man a whole lot of prep time.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B., Dad can handle it.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael, Dad?
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," Yeah, you know, he's a fun guy, and I'm making him my best man."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael, You're making Dad your best man? That's great. I guess being your brother and solving all your problems for you doesn't qualify me as your best man.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," Hey, if he wants to support me, I'm not going to tell him to go to hell. Don't worry. You're still..."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," What, invited?"
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," No, I was going to say you're still the guy I want solving my problems. But, yeah, let me talk to Dad about that invite situation."

1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George," Well, she's costing me enough, but she's, oh, she's a hell of a stripper."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," No, I mean my wife."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George," Oh, well I... I doubt that very much."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," Well, I came to tell you that Michael was pretty upset that you wanted to be best man."

1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," Yeah, my bachelor party's about having fun, right?"
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George," No, your bachelor party's about convincing Gilligan that he's killed a stripper, getting him out of town so he can't testify, and making sure that people think that he took the money."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B., It is?
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George, Yeah.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George," This accountant can do us a lot of damage. I want him neutralized. Do you hear me? That's why I want you to use this stripper. A narcoleptic, believe it or not. A friend of mine at the Yacht Club, he used her for his bachelor party."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George, We wanted you to have the first piece.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George," Put her in a darkened space, she's out. Then you get him drunk, he passes out. Then you cover the floor with corn syrup mixed with a little red dye. Then comes to, ""Eek, blood. Ah!"" He freaks out."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," Okay, but how do you know that he's going to leave the country?"
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George, That's what I got you those honeymoon tickets. You never thanked me for those.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to. I was going to..."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George, You just have to convince him that this happened.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B., That he killed a stripper?
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George," Can you do this? Can I trust you? You're not going to go all Michael on me, are you?"
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," Nobody's turning all Michael on you. But when you get out, then we're going to have a real party, right, Dad?"
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George," Are you kidding? When I get out of here, you're going to throw me the biggest party this town's ever seen, all right?"

1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Lindsay," Well, maybe if I was allowed to have a Zanotab, I'd remember it's Euphorazine."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Tobias," No, we are not going to do that again. This family is not about to start using. We are pushers, not takers."

1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael, I just booked us a little fishing trip.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George Michael," Why, what did I do?"
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," No, no, this is a fun thing, okay? Something I've always wanted to do with you. And everybody's always having fun around here. Why can't we?"
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Lindsay, It's already down. (Muffled.) Get your finger out of my throat. It's down.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George Michael," Anyway, I thought you hated fishing."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," No, it's fun. I like fun. I just hated doing it with my dad. This is going to be you and me, okay?"

1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George Michael," It's actually why I'm such a good natural percussionist. And, um... I'm just... worried that I'm not going to be able to fall asleep for another two hours and 45 minutes. So I was thinking maybe I would go down and check out Maeby's band?

1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," I'm right where I want to be. G.O.B. had his chance to have me there, but if you're sure you can't sleep..."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George Michael," It's just I don't know when I'm gonna get another chance like this, you know, to be there for family. I'd hate to miss it because I was too proud."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," Right. Wait a minute. ""Too proud""? What does this have to do with too proud?"
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,George Michael, Actually that part was kind of just for you. I was just worried the whole thing wasn't going to land unless I included the pride part.

1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B., Gilligan killed the skipper... stripper!

1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B., (Sighs.) What does it matter? I screwed it up anyway. I'm a complete failure. I can't even fake the death of a stripper.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael, Come on. That's not a bad thing. That doesn't make you a failure. Dad's the failure.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," Really? When he was my age, he ran an entire company, he had kids."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," Well, the company was corrupt. Look what he's trying to do to us. And I'll tell you something else- you might not be a father, you know, G.O.B., but you are my brother."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B., I might be a father.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," Why don't you start trusting yourself, okay? Not-Not Dad. You're a much better man than he is."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.," And you're a better man than both of us. You're the best man. You're my best man. I mean, not if I have an actual ceremony, 'cause Dad would kill me, but... What do you say, hermano? Help me clean up this mess?"
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael, What the hell.

1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Michael," No, no. She..."
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,G.O.B.’s wife, ...In-law. Tobias. Sorry. I should have finished that thought.

1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Narrator, ... and Gilligan fulfills his destiny.
1,Best Man for the Gob,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Best_Man_for_the_Gob,Ira Gilligan, Let it ring.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator, Michael was preparing for a meeting with the Bluth Company Board to determine what to do with some recently unfrozen funds.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay," Wow. Exciting, huh? Finally getting some money."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," What do you want, Lindsay?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay, I'd like some of that money.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Well, this money is for land, okay? We're not going to burn through it like Dad did when he was in charge with his bad investments and his corrupt dealings... Mother's neck..."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay," No, that was a good investment."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," It is easier to look at now, isn't it?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay, What if I told you the money was for something really worthwhile?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, Like what?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay," I want to have an affair. Now, I'm not sure with who yet, but I will need lingerie, waxings... these are some real costs, Michael."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, I take it things aren't getting better with Tobias?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay, What's that supposed to mean?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," Things hadn't been getting better with Michael's sister and her husband, even after she came up with a plan to get his attention."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay," Oh, my God, listen to the radio. I haven't heard this since we first started dating. I just feel like using my body."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Tobias," Well, Lindsay, could you use it over there? I'm trying to grow."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay," Yeah. Well, it's clear that's not going to happen."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay, We had sex once in the last year and he just laid there.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," All right, look. This money is for land, okay? I'm not giving to give you money to go have an affair. Why don't you pick something else to boost up your self-worth? How 'bout, uh, charity? Why don't you get back to your roots?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay, It has been a while. All right. I'm going to go do that right now.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," You're going to get your hair done, aren't you?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay," Well, if I'm going to have an affair..."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator, Michael got a message he intended to ignore... until he read the next line.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," A matter of land, Mom?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille," Oh, that's funny. I meant ""a matter of ‘L' and ‘D'."" Life and death."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, What is the matter of life and death?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille," Buster's jaw clicks when he eats. I think it's what's driving his friends away. I sent him to Canada for an operation, so I'll need some of that new money that just came in."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," You know, Mom, if you want an operation that's really going to help him you ought to have them finally cut that cord."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, He needs me.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, He doesn't need you. You coddle him. He's too old to go running to Mommy with all his problems.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, I seem to remember a certain someone running to Mommy when his Algebra teacher made an example of him.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator, Michael had been suspended when another boy cheated off his test.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," ...Tracy won't marry me, I won't get a job..."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, Shh-shh-shh-shh.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, What is this? What's happening?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, Let Mama take care of it. I'll have a little chat with Mr. Vandenbosch.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," The next day, Mr. Vandenbosch was not in school. He was never heard from again."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, I know life is not fair to women. Your children grow up and they don't need you anymore.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, And I seem to remember a certain grown man who completely fell apart two weeks ago when I taped over the Nova special that had the girl on it he liked.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, That was Buster. That's my point.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," George Michael, meanwhile, was at the frozen banana stand when he thought he spotted a familiar face."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George Michael," Pop-Pop? Oh, sorry, Miss. Pop-Pop?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Maeby, You think you saw Pop-Pop?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George Michael," But with hair. Which is probably why he asked for my hair, remember?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George, Give Pop-Pop your hair! Give me the hair!
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Maeby," It all adds up. He stole somebody's hair, made a wig, knocked out the guard, tunneled his way through a sewer line and stopped to get a candy apple on his way to Mexico."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George Michael, Of course! You're mocking me.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Maeby, Of course.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George Michael," I know what I saw, Maeby, and there's no other explanation."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George," So, listen, my twin brother's in town. I want you to take care of him."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, You still see Uncle Oscar?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George," Tell you what. Give him ten grand from the new cash, just send him on his way."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Dad, the money is for the business, okay? I'm not just going to hand it all out."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George," Michael, this is my brother. Do you know what it's like to have a sibling who has no source of income except for you?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Just one? No, no idea. It sounds wonderful, though. Look, the board is watching every move I make, especially that guy Jordan. He's just waiting for me to screw up so he can blow the whistle on me."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George, Why don't you just buy him out of his stock?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," No, no, he wants twice the value. Listen, stop telling me what to do with the money, please. I've got a plan for the board meeting that's going to take the gun right out of Jordan's hand."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Mr. Jordan," Listen, you've got the money now and you know my price. You don't need a whistle blower around here."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Interesting choice of words, Mr. Jordan. He's right, we don't need a whistle blower. We need a building full of whistle blowers. Okay? Whistles. I want this place to be honest. That's exactly why I had these made up for us. When you see something wrong..."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, There you go. I want you to report it. I want you to...
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Exactly. Just like that. I want us to police ourselves vigilantly... Let's wait till something's actually happens, though."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, All right... Good fun... Enough!
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," 45, 46, 47..."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Okay, there's still three whistles left out there. Who's got the whistles?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Board Member #1, He kept one.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," There's a good example of whistle blowing, okay, but you've kept yours, so it's hurting your case."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Board Member #1, I was in the bathroom when you asked for it back.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Board Member #2," No, he wasn't."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," In any event, we are going to be responsible with this money."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Tobias," Michael, I hope I'm not interrupting anything, but I'd love to get a hunk of that new company money."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Tobias," I just need to prove to my wife that I can act like a man. And it's not about sex. I don't just lie there, if that's what you're thinking."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, That's not what I was thinking.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.," Sorry, just had a quick question for Michael."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, Is this about the money?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B., No.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, What do you want?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.," It's not about money in the sense that I'm coming here saying, ""Here, Michael. Take some money."" It's just more of a ""may I have some"" kind of visit."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, Don't you have a wife that you can go ask now?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B., She left me.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, For Tobias?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Tobias, For me?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.," No, she doesn't even like you."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.’s wife, I'm in love with your brother-in-law.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B., You're in love with your own brother? The one in the army?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.’s wife," No, your sister's husband."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B., Michael? Michael!
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.’s wife," No, that's your sister's brother."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.," No, I'm my sister's brother. You're in love with me- me."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.’s wife, I'm in love with Tobias.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B., My brother-in-law?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.’s wife," I know it can never be, so I'm leaving. I'm enlisting in the army."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B., To be with your brother.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.’s wife, No.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.," Anyway, I can't be expected to live on the $800 a month Army-wife stipend that I'm going to get."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Tobias, They just don't support the spouses.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," You don't want to end up like Uncle Oscar, okay -- living off handouts your whole life. Why don't you come up with a way to make money? A suggestion of something to invest in, or maybe a business idea."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Tobias," Well, I've always wanted to remake ""Annie Hall"". Except, I wouldn't want to get in bed with a green producer like a Sofia Coppola though. Oh, but give me an old pro like a Robert Redford. Oh, I'd jump into bed with him in a second. And I wouldn't just lie there, Michael Bluth, if that's what you're thinking."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Actually, that time, that was what I was thinking."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," And later that day, Maeby spotted something interesting."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," Lindsay, meanwhile, arrived at the salon, hoping to increase her self-esteem. Unfortunately, her stylist had just been called up by his reserve unit."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay, What's happening? Where are you going?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Alex, I'm not allowed to tell. It's the war.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay," Oh, come on. These salon wars have got to stop."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Alex," The war, Lindsay. The real war."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," Lindsay was stunned-not just that she was losing her stylist, but that apparently there was a war going on."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay," Well, I'm protesting this war. You're my friend and I'm not going to let Shauna cut my hair. I'm going to take a stand."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," And Lindsay found a solution to her self-esteem problem. G.O.B. and Tobias, meanwhile, were brainstorming at a local coffee shop."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B., I need a cup of coffee to focus.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Tobias," It's so crowded in here. I can't think. Okay, what is it that people need?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B., People love to carbo-load.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B., The bagel place.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Tobias, There you go.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Hey, guys, what's going on?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B., Just researching our investment.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Oh, yeah, coffee places? I've thought about these. I'll tell you what, you guys come up with a proposal, we'll try one."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," G.O.B. and Tobias accidentally had Michael on the hook, and they didn't want to blow the deal."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, I guess that's a response.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar," Hey, nephew."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Oh, hey, Uncle Oscar. How are you doing?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar," Wow, you are like, ""Oh, the tension."" Come on. Okay, that's plenty."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, What are you doing?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar, Right there.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, What's happening now?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," The two men caught up, neither one anxious to bring up the issue at hand."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar, One on the lips.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, No.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, I'm running the business a little bit differently.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar," Well, you do the best with what you have. I have lemons, I make lemonade."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, That's a very positive attitude.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar," But I hate the lemonade business, I hate the grind. You have to grind so many (bleep)ing lemons."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," You're not a very metaphorical person, are you?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar, I need money.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, I know.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar, I can not tell you how that has weighed on me.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, Why don't we sit over here?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," So, I've got too many people watching me too closely. So, if you're willing to work or if you have something of value..."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar," The only thing I have of value is my land. I could give you the rights to ""All You Need Are Smiles."" It was a song I wrote for David Cassidy. He was going to sing it on the Mike Douglas show, but he was too embarrassed to do it in front of John and Yoko."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, Tell me about the land?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar," Oh, land, it's a couple hundred acres of lemon groves, right near Camp Pendleton."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," If you're willing to part with that land, Uncle Oscar, I can guarantee you a little bit more than that $10,000."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar," To be honest, I've often thought of giving it up to pursue my lost love. A love that was taken from me."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, I hope that was the espresso machine.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," Michael made the trip to survey the land. It was, indeed, beautiful. And the next day, he went to his father to tell him."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George, You give that gift to my brother?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Gift? No, I did not give him a gift. I told you, the money was for investing. and that's exactly what I did with it, Pop."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George," Oh, Michael, this guy's got nothing in his life. He wrote one song that made Joan Baez call him ""the shallowest man in the world."" He has a worthless piece of property, and, yes, a head of hair. Only because he's never had to work for a living."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, What piece of property is worthless?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George," The grove, you know, where he lives. I mean, you can't build on it, the government has an easement on it."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, Does Oscar know this?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George," Of course he knows it. I mean, they run their tanks through there. Occasionally, they stop for a little lemonade, but what's that? That's a buck fifty. You can't make much from that."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," Indeed, the land was valueless."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar, Fellas! Fellas!
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George, So... tell me about this investment you made.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," Back at the model home, Lindsay had decided to not take her hairdresser's departure lying down."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay," I'm protesting the war. There's a war going on, you know."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Maeby," Yeah. I'm the one who told you, and you said it happened ten years ago."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George Michael, Isn't this the same sign you used to picket the cable company when they dropped the Style Network?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay," Actually, I used this one for Michael when he was too cheap to pay for the premium channels, but I added the bit about stylists."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Maeby, You know that secret you have? The one about the hair that nobody's supposed to see? I saw it. I saw Pop-Pop!
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George Michael," Oh, right. Pop-Pop! With hair!"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George Michael," You know, I should tell my dad."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Maeby," No, you sissy. He might need us to help him. So we should go check out the prison, and make sure he's not there."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Hey, you know, I got cable. You won that one."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," Michael was embarrassed about the bad investment he'd made, and hoping to keep it a secret."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar, Hi. This is Oscar. I'm off pursuing my lady love. Leave a message. I'll get back to you next summer.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Hey, it's Michael. I know that you think that you've disappeared, but I will find you."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George Michael, Who's... who's disappeared?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, No one. Why do you ask? Have you seen someone?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George Michael, I've seen no one!
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, Then you haven't seen anyone who looks like Pop-Pop?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George Michael, No. Why? Has someone who looks like Pop-Pop disappeared?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, No. Of course not.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Tobias, Have you seen the agricultural report?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.," Nothing's hotter than coffee. The trend is up. So, if we could get that check from you."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Well, I'm not just going to hand out a check, okay? You got... you got to come up with an investment plan."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.," Oh, we've got an investment plan."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," ""G.O.B.-ias"" Industries."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.," Gobias. As in, ""Go buy us some coffee."""
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, It's great. Looks good.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.," So, when do I start making my monies?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Well, there may not be as much investment capital as... as we thought. The money's kind of tied up in this land deal."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Tobias, This is the first any of us at Gobias Industries have heard of a land deal.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B., Maybe we could borrow on that land.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," There's not much to borrow against. The deal seems to be bad. It's Uncle Oscar's land, and it may be worthless."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B., And the board okayed it?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, They weren't notified.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.," Damn it! Every time, Dad does this to us!"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," G.O.B., Dad wasn't..."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.," He went around you, he went around the board..."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, What are you going to do?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B., I'm going to go down to that prison and give him a piece of my mind.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," G.O.B., no, you don't need to do that."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,G.O.B.," No. I'm doing it! No, because you're in charge now. And I'm telling him that!"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," No, no, no. Listen, G.O.B., he's human, okay? He's a human being. And let me try to get us out of this. Let me see if I can get Dad out of this mess that he has created for himself, okay?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Tobias, I'm afraid this offer comes off the table at midnight tonight.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, That may be the worst bluff I've ever seen.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator, Even the members of Gobias agreed on that one.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," The next day, Lindsay, having found out about a military exercise, joined a protest group and went off to exercise her own First Amendment rights."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Military Official," This way, please. This way. Thank you. Right here. This way. I'd ask you to make sure you're fully inside the free-speech zone before beginning your protest."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay, Free-speech zone? This is where we're protesting? This isn't right. Where are the cameras?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Military Official," They're in the free-press zone. And, if you could save your comments until you're completely loaded into the cage."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay," Well, at least the procession will come through here. They'll see us protest."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Activist," Actually, they're using their right to cut through the lemon grove."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Military Official," Okay, have fun. Enjoy your right to free speech. The armed forces welcomes your dissent."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay," Well, hopefully somebody will come by we can protest."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," Meanwhile, George Michael and Maeby went to the prison."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George, My grandchildren. What a surprise!
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Maeby," Well, he's here."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George, Of course I'm here. Where else would I be?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George Michael, We thought you broke out of prison and were on the lam with stolen hair.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George," Don't you think that, if I got out of here, that I might want to go home?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Maeby," That's what we thought, but then my dad told us about that lemon grove that you bought, and we thought you were going there."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George Michael, But don't worry. We would never blow the whistle on family.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,George, What lemon grove?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator, And so Michael went back to the board to take responsibility for his mistakes.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, My dad screwed up. He bought something that he shouldn't have. But I guess that's why he's behind bars.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Mr. Jordan," Yeah, and he's not allowed to conduct any business from there."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Right. Yeah. I was involved. It wasn't all his decision. You see, it was his idea, and then I carried out the transaction."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Mr. Jordan," That's even worse. Conspiracy to commit fraud. Of course, you could always buy me off the board."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," We don't have the money anymore. I assure you that nothing illegal happened here. I misspoke. My dad, in no way, is talking about business from prison."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Ted," Excuse me. Your father's calling from prison. He wants to talk to you about the land deal you made with his brother. Hey, I found this on your desk. Can I keep this?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," Back at the free-speech zone, Lindsay's protest had started to gain some attention. But not from any key decision makers."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Local Man #1, I thought we were seeing a gay marriage.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Local Man #2," Well, we can still hose them down."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay, What do we want?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,All, Peace and freedom.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay," Where's everyone going? What, are you giving up?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Activist," Face it, Lindsay, they've won."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay," Well, I am not going anywhere. All your water's doing is whetting my appetite for protest. No hair for oil! No hair for oil!"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Local Man #1," Fine, we'll drown you out with music."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay, Crank it up! I'm in the mood to dance.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," Lindsay discovered that the activism that came out of her desire for prettier hair really did boost her self-esteem. While Michael, with nowhere else to turn, made a rare, unsolicited visit to his mother's."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille," Michael? I hope you're here to bring me a check for Buster's surgery. They made him stop eating after midnight, and he's hungry, and he's in a foreign land, and his jaw is clicking, and he's scared."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," I don't have the money, all right, Mom?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, Then why are you here?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," I don't know, I don't know."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, So... how's work?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," It's not great, Mom, since you asked. It's just, it's not that great. You know, I got, I got a board member who's trying to extort me and a seller I can't find. This whole real estate thing is a total mess. I got Dad completely..."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, What? What did your father do? Did he try to screw something up for you again?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," No, he didn't screw anything up. I screwed something up, Mom. I, I did it, and Dad is just, you know, furious at me, and he should be, you know? He told me to pay off his brother, and I didn't, and instead I bought his worthless land."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, With the lemons and the tanks?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," I know it! The first investment I made with the company money, and it's a total disaster. Then I went ahead and lied about it, which is going to let this board member bring the company down. I'm going to ruin this family, Mom."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, Shh. Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, What's this? What's happening?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, It's going to be all right.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, Why are you squeezing me with your body?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille," It's a hug, Michael; I'm hugging you."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Well, why?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, Because you need your mother right now.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," But I don't get along with m... Sorry, that was, that was a knee jerk."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille," Michael, you made a mistake. You're a human being. But you're so forgiving to everyone else in this family. Try being forgiving to yourself. Now, if you'll excuse me. Let Mama take care of it."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," No, no, Mom, come on, I don't want you to do anything. Hey, this isn't algebra. I'm a big boy. Mother, do not make somebody dis... disappear."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille," Now, there's someone who could have used a good mother. Whore!"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," And so, before Oscar could leave to find his true love, she found him."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, Oscar!
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar, Lucille! You look fantastic! You still have the neck of a 20-year-old.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, And you still have the hair of a lion. Take back the land.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar, That's it? But I-I thought we could have this brief moment to... reconnect.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille," Oscar, your brother is in jail right now. My husband is in jail."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar, You're right.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille," So, what's the rush?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator, And the next day...
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, Michael.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Hey, Mom. Hi. Uh, listen, I'm sorry about yesterday. It was a moment of weakness. Now, I got to go into this board meeting. I'm going to tell them the truth. If this guy Jordan tries to get me fired, maybe I deserve it."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, He's gone. We bought out his shares.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, With what?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, With the money you tried to spend on that lemon grove.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, You got it back? How?
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," You know, about what I was saying about how people outlive their usefulness? That was out of line."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille," I know. But you made a good point. Maybe I do need something to occupy my time, other than my children."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael," Well, if you do want to spend it together, it's fine with me."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille," I'm so glad to hear that. All right, let's get this meeting started. Why have we been spending so much money on whistles?"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, Michael finds having his mother on the board problematic..."
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, We have to be courageous.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille," I remember a certain young man who used to say, ""But I don't have bad dreams in your bed."""
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Michael, That was Buster.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator, ... Lindsay finds her true calling ...
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lindsay, I want to be... a cage dancer.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Narrator, ... and Oscar comes a-courtin'.
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Oscar," (recording in radio) All you need is smiles, Lots and lots of smily smiles!"
1,Whistler's Mother,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Whistler%27s_Mother,Lucille, What is that racket?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator," Michael was heading off to work when his son, George Michael, reminded him of a yearly tradition."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael," Hey, don't forget me."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, For what?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael," It's Bring Your Daughter to Work Day. Unless you had a daughter I don't know about, I'm your girl."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator, Michael had first made this joke when George Michael was six.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Well, she's not my daughter, but it's about as close as I'm going to get."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Young George Michael, I'm a good little girl. (Curtsies.)
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator, It was a joke Michael was starting to grow concerned about as it had not worn well with age.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael," Hey, Dad. They're out of sanitary napkins in the ladies washroom. (Laughing.)"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George, Weird kid.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, I don't this year it's such a good idea. You're getting older and you're...
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael," Yeah, right. Pretty soon I'm going to have to start wearing a bra. Right, Dad? All right, give me one minute."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Really, let's not this year. I cannot kill this joke. Hey, shouldn't you be getting dressed?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby," No, going with my dad to work today."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Tobias," Hey, peanut butter cup."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, This is work- watching entertainment news?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Tobias," Well, excuse me, Michael, for not raising the perfect daughter that you did. I indulged this ritual for years in Boston."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator," As a psychotherapist, Tobias was on the forefront of the self-esteem movement."

1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Young Maeby, Homosexual.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Tobias," Maeby, please. She's right, though, you probably are a homosexual."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," So, Maeby, this is what you're gonna do this year? You're gonna watch him watch TV?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Tobias," Oh, bless her. It's like she knew what I was going to do next."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B., Newport Beach. It's from the act I did on the beach over spring break.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator, G.O.B. had recently done a magic show where he had made the Bluth family yacht disappear. It was spring break and the act was filmed for the popular video series Girls With Low Self-Esteem.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B.," This puts me back on top of the old magic career, though."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Hang on. G.O.B., you're not going to put that in. There's nudity on that. Maeby, why don't you go upstairs and get dressed."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Tobias," I must warn you, Michael, she doesn't respond well to strict directives."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby, All right.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Tobias, That was odd.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Not really. Kids love boundaries. I mean, look at these girls. Is this what you want?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Tobias," Oh, God, no."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, This could be where your daughter is headed.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Tobias," Oh, no, no, I don't want this for Maeby either."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B.," Oh, here it is. Here it is."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Announcer," It was a wild time on the beach, and if you like magic, look away. The only thing this guy could make fly away was the crowd."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Tobias, Douche-chill.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B.," I can't believe they used that part, the one part that I screwed up. It's not like they used the part where I made the yacht disappear."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, Sunk the yacht. Blew it up. Sunk it.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B., We sure did.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, We? No. I gave you permission to use the yacht. You blew it up.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B.," Yeah, well, if you give someone permission to use a tissue, you can't be upset if they blow their nose. Right? I mean..."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Lindsay, new outfit?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay," This? No, I've had this for years. I think it's a hand-me-down from Mom."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, You got a price tag. Right there.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay, Is there? I guess she wanted me to have something new. Sweet old thing.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Only two of those words describe Mom, so I know you're lying to me."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay," Fine. I bought it before we went broke, okay? I just haven't worn it yet."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, What about the outfit yesterday?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay, Old thing gave it to me.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, Where are you getting all the money?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay," It's not costing you anything, Michael."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Unless you're stealing or working, I'm pretty sure it is."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay, That's right. I stole it.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator," In fact, Lindsay, tired of wearing last year's fashions, went to an upscale department store, and in a moment of desperation applied for a job. But she was ashamed of being a shop girl, and was relieved when Michael gave her the out."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay," Well, they expect a certain amount of theft, Michael. It's built into the price. If I didn't take it, then people would be overpaying for nothing."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B.," So you're saying you walked in, and without anyone noticing, took an entire outfit? There's no way that you can do sleight-of-hand that well. I don't even think that I could do it."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Yeah, I've seen your tape."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Lindsay, this is appalling."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B., What'd you use for misdirection?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay, Misdirection?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B.," Yeah, I mean, if you're so good at magic, what did you have them looking at to divert their attention?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay, I don't know. My ass.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B., My ass. You're lying.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay," No, I'm not."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, You're gonna take that back.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay," No, I'm not. This has nothing to do with you. You're not my father."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," No, our father is in prison for stealing, remember? Which might not be a bad place for you to get used to."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay," Michael, it was shoplifting, and I'm white. I think I'm going to be okay."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby, Shoplifting? Cool. Can you take me?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," No, not cool. You know what? Maeby, you're going to come with me to work today. You're gonna be my daughter. You're gonna have a role model in your life who is honest, who doesn't steal, doesn't lie and I don't know, watch entertainment news."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay," Michael, don't worry about it, okay? She's not going to go with you."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby, Okay.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, Great.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay, That was odd.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, I'm going to teach you two a little something about hands-on parenting.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael, Hey dad. Do you think this purse goes with this outfit? Where'd my dad go?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Tobias, Douche-chill.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator, And so Michael took his niece to Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby, You can just drop me off at the mall.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Oh, no, you're really coming with me. You're gonna learn a little something about hard work."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, Hey. Maeby! Maeby!
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby," Okay. So you can run faster than me, but you can't make me work."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," No one's making you do anything, you know. It's just a chance for us to spend some time together. Learn about business, you know. You might find you're good at things you didn't even know about."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," See that? Who knew you were such a good little climber? Now listen. Let's make this fun, okay?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," What is better than hanging out with family, hmm? Yeah. [Bleep.] It's my mother."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, Hey.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Buster," Oh, she called you, huh? I guess I'm not good enough to be her husband."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, What? What's going on?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Annyong, Okay. Mother want someone to go to my soccer game with. She don't want other soccer moms think that she is single mother. She old school.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," I liked it better when he just said ""Annyong."""
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Hey, Mom, why can't Buster pretend to be your escort? That's the way he's got in all his cartoons."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lucille, They already know he's my son.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Buster, I wouldn't go even if you asked.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Buster, You didn't let me play soccer as a child. Why should I have to sit and cheer Annyong? Annyong never cheers me.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Annyong," Go, fatty."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lucille, Stop it! He's your little brother.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Buster, No he's not! I came out of you. He didn't.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Can you not call me with these little things, please? The office is a mess. I still haven't replaced Kitty."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator," Michael had recently fired his father's longtime assistant, Kitty. It had not been a clean break."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," So, I got a lot of work to do. Plus, it's Bring Your Daughter to Work Day."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lucille, Oh? Where is George Michael?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," I told him not to come. I thought it was important to bring Maeby this y... Damn it. Can you just find somebody else, please, to look like your husband?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator," In fact, there was someone else who looked like Lucille's husband-his twin brother, Oscar."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Oscar, Lucille.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator, And although she knew it was wrong to play with his heart...
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lucille," Oscar, it's Lucille."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator, ... she really didn't want to go to the soccer game alone.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lucille, I need you.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator," And back at the model home, three of the Bluth men struggled with their manliness."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael," You know, I make these jokes about being a daughter for my dad, and I know I'm a man. It's his insecurity, not mine."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B., There's no security at that store. That's how she was able to shoplift. Probably don't even have a regular security guard.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Tobias," Well, of course I could get a job as a security guard. I mean, if I have to have a job to impress my daughter. If she needs something that butch."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael," Yeah, I can hang out with my uncles. I mean, three men. What's butcher than that?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B., I'm going to the mall.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Tobias," Me, too."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael," Yeah, maybe a new pair of shoes will cheer me up."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, And now I'm filling out an expense report so I can sleep well at night knowing that I have been honest. You're not asleep.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby, I was.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, You were not.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, I'd like to see if you can go one day without telling a lie. Just one whole day without being like your mom.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby, What's in it for me if I do?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, You'll win my respect.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby, Good night.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, And 50 bucks.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby, Fine. I'll do it if you do it.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, That a girl. This is gonna be fun.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby, I win.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Officer Taylor, We're looking for a Michael Bluth.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, That's me. I'm Michael Bluth.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Officer Taylor," I'm Officer Taylor. That's Officer Carter. Our daughters Tammy and Moni... Oh, God, what? Where did they go?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Officer Carter, I'm on it.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, How can I help you?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Officer Taylor," Well, we're here investigating the disappearance of Kitty Sanchez. Apparently, you're the last person to see her. Alive. Or around town or whatever."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," I don't know anything about that. I do know that, uh, she was my secretary, but she left. Or I-I fired her."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Officer Taylor, Did you ever threaten her?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," No, no. God no. Of course not."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Kitty, Michael Bluth is threatening me!
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," I-I did, I threatened her at a restaurant, but, you know. It's a restaurant. So... Certainly she's been seen since then."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Officer Taylor, Not alive. Or dead or whatever.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Officer Taylor, We'd love to speak with you down at the station.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Sure. You know, I-I-I'm happy to cooperate, but I really don't know anything more than you know. I certainly didn't, didn't kill her and drop her in the Back Bay. Boy, I hope that's not what happened to her."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Officer Taylor, I'm sure it isn't. (Into radio.) Please send Officer Davis and little Hannah to the Back Bay.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby," So, you killed Kitty, huh?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," No, I didn't kill Kitty, but I will go down to the station and answer those nice men's questions. You know why? 'Cause I have no secrets to hide, because I'm an honest man."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, And apparently a fun one. Let's go see what's going on in the back room.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby, Those the last words Kitty ever heard?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Girl on Video," No, I will not kiss her."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Man on Video, But it's spring break.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Girl on Video, Okay.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Hey, guys. What are you doing? It's Bring Your Daughter to Work Day."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Ted," Yeah, that's my Caitlin."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Okay, there is work to be done. Can we get back to it? Thank you. Oh, and... has anybody seen or heard from Kitty lately?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Employee," I think that's her right behind you, there."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Oh, my God, that is Kitty."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby," And that's the boat Uncle G.O.B. blew up. Hey, now you have something to tell them at the station."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator, Tobias sought out a security position at the nearby mall.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Tobias," I do know stage combat if the partner is willing and a bit more petite than I. But I have a daughter to impress, and I need this job."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Supervisor," Well, it's going to be a couple days before we can get you a gun license, so... you'll have to use mine."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Tobias, Wow.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator," Meanwhile, G.O.B. had taken George Michael on a mysterious errand."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael, What are we getting? Is it something for a magic trick?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B., In a way.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael," You know, it's so great to be hanging out with you. There are certain things that I can talk to you about that I can't really with my dad, like, uh... were-were you ever awkward around girls?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B.," What do you mean? Like if there were three of us and I didn't know where to start? No, I think I did pretty well. Not a lot of complaints, if you know what I mean. At least not from the girl."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael, You're saying I should just be myself?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B.," And he had to drive her home, so I think I did pretty good. Pretty damn good."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B.," Hey, guy, how many mice will $13 buy?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator," And at the prison, George Sr. had a surprise visitor."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Buster, Just wanted to check in and make sure you're aware that your ban on organized sports in this family has been violated.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George, Ban on organized sports?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Buster," You know, how you wouldn't let me sign up for anything when I was a kid."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George," Is that what you've been thinking all these years? No, no, look, you were... you were just a turd out there, you know? You couldn't kick, and you couldn't run, you know? You were just a turd."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Buster," Prison has destroyed the way you talk. If that's what it takes to impress these guys around here, then they are not your friends."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Buster," Anyway, Annyong's playing soccer, but I guess I should just ignore it, look the other way as Mom and Uncle Oscar and Annyong have a perfect little family..."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George," Whoa, whoa whoa. Oscar? My brother Oscar? Oscar's been coming around?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Guard's Daughter, No touching!
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George," No touching. No touching. You listen to me. You got to take care of this Oscar situation. You get him out of there, all right? You make him wish he never showed that ludicrous head of hair and that nice face of his."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Buster," I will do it, Dad."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George, Good. Put her there.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Guard's Daughter, (Pounding table.) No touching!
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Guard, Her self-esteem is through the roof.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator, And Michael arrived at the police station with Maeby.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Barry, I got here as quickly as I could.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, I didn't know you had a daughter.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Barry, I don't.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Barry's Girlfriend," I thought you wanted me to call you ""Daddy."""
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Barry, Why don't you wait for Daddy in the car?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Barry, All right. What do we have here?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," G.O.B. sunk the yacht. Last time Kitty was seen, she was getting onto it. It's on tape."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Barry, Ooh! Did you see this?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby, Yup.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Barry, Ooh! Chills. Why do I keep getting these bruises?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, Barry.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Barry," Okay. Until we get all the facts, don't say anything that can incriminate you. Or me. Just try to keep me out of this. Lie. Both of you."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," No. What are you talking- we don't lie in this family. Maeby, why don't you get a soda? [To Barry] If I lie in front of her, it costs me 50 bucks. I do think that we should lie."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator," Meanwhile, Lindsay was at work, and starting to get jealous that her daughter was at work with Michael."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay," [On phone] Hello Michael. I know you think I'm such a horrible mother, but I was just seeing how my daughter was doing at work."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Uh, she's, um... She's making lots of friends already. [To Barry] Will you help me there, please?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator, It was at this moment that G.O.B. and George Michael arrived at the store.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael," You know, say what you will about America. 13 bucks still gets you a hell of a lot of mice."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B., Who said anything bad about America?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael," Yeah, well, I meant... So what are the mice for?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B.," No they're just for misdirection. We'll see who's the sleight-of-hand artist is in this family. Okay, now, when I yell ""mice"", I want you to open this box, and I'm going to start stuffing some shirts down your pants."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael," Shirts? G.O.B., are we shoplifting?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B., Mice!
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay," Michael, I'm not as bad an influence as you think I am."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Well, you're not a great one. You're a criminal, Lindsay, what kind of message does that send?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Detective Fellows," Bluth, we're ready to question you now."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay," That's what I am, Michael. I'm a shoplifter. I've got a whole bag of clothes I shoplifted."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator, But Tobias was now a guard... and a surprisingly cat-like one.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B., Wow. Guess we didn't need the mice.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Supervisor's Daughter," Freeze, [bleep]hole."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator," While the rest of the Bluths were in police custody, Lucille was with her brother-in-law."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Oscar," I am blown away that you... that you called me, and that we're-we're together, and my camper made it all the way up here- do you think it's safe over there, because I only have a hanger for a lock."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lucille," What are they going to take, the one can of Comet you've got in there?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Oscar," Oh, your tongue is as sharp as your body is still taut."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lucille," What are you doing? Oscar, this is a children's soccer game, not Woodstock."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Oscar," Oh, that was another era, huh? The music and the pot... Will you excuse me? I'm need to go to my camper for just a quick sec."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Oscar, Open.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Buster," Hey, Uncle."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Oscar, Hey... Buster.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Oscar," No, no... No, no... ow. No, no, no. No, no, no."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Buster," No, no, no! I came here to say something. You do not belong here. My mother's been spoken for. You know, I may never have played organized sports, but I am a man."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Oscar, Buster...
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Buster, And I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Oscar," Okay, but I never meant to break up your family. Your mom called me for a reason. I-I don't think she's happy."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Buster," No, she's happy. She's just mean all the time. Oh... No, uncle. I'm a man..."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator, Michael submitted to the detective's questions.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Detective Fellows, You haven't seen any evidence of Ms. Sanchez or where she might have gone?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," I have, uh, no idea. None."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Detective Fellows, Are you willing to take a polygraph to that effect?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Barry, Are you nuts?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, Not without a better lawyer.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Detective Steudler, You're holding out on us. Fantastic. Now Emma's awake.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Barry, You know what? Let me take care of this.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, Please.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Barry, / Too ra loo ra loo ra... /
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Detective Fellows," Kitty had evidence against your father, and you didn't want that to come out, but now you've got bigger problems, my friend, so why don't we make a deal?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," What, I give you evidence against my father and you pretend that I didn't kill Kitty? I mean, I-I didn't kill Kitty."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Hello. Oh, hey, George Michael. Uh, I'm sorry. In your pants? I'll be right there. Um, my son has an emergency."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Detective Fellows, I Can't Hold It In. Worked for us.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator, Buster emerged from Oscar's trailer with a newfound sense of manliness... and then received a serendipitous gift.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Kid #2, Kick it back!
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Kid #3," If you can kick, fatty."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Buster, I'm a man.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lucille, What are you doing?! Get off of the field. Are you crazy?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator, And Buster realized he may have just scared away a man who supported him in the way he'd always hoped his own father would. And Michael headed over to the mall.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," So, what the hell is this, huh?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael," Hey, Dad, I didn't know we were shoplifting, okay?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Shoplifting? What's the matter with you, G.O.B.?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B., What's the matter with me? She's the shoplifter.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay," I wasn't shoplifting, you twit."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Tobias," Yes, thanks to me."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay, No. I work here.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay," At least I used to. They fired me because they thought I was helping this idiot shoplift. Also, they said I wasn't a very good salesgirl."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay, (Laughing at co-worker's outfit.) You can't be serious.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,G.O.B.," A salesgirl. I knew it! I knew you couldn't pull it off. There's only one magician in this family, and that is me."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael," Yeah, and you got caught by a 13-year-old girl."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," You know, this is why I'm constantly asking you to stay away from my son."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael," Yeah, well, it's not like you were there to spend any time with me, Dad, 'cause I'm not daughter enough for you."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," George Michael, um, I'm always there for you, okay? It's just you're getting a little too manly for Bring Your Daughter to Work Day."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael," Dad, that's what makes it funny."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, I also wanted to give Maeby a good role model for a change.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,George Michael," Yeah, well, I guess you looking out for her is probably something she could use."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Lindsay, Where is Maeby?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator," Michael realized he had to get to the police station before they got a hold of Maeby, to whom he'd promised $50 to tell the truth."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, I've put a bounty on my own head.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator, But Maeby's instincts to lie returned.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Detective Steudler," Hey, you can't go in there."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby," No, it's okay. I'm Detective Fellows' daughter."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Detective Steudler," Oh, oh, sorry. It's four, three, five. That opens any door in the building."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby, Great. Thanks.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator, And it was there that Maeby discovered the key to Michael's freedom.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Detective Fellows," Well, I appreciate your honesty."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, Maeby. What-what-what'd she say?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby," I said there's a tape of Kitty getting on the boat and you guys blew it up. I told them the truth, like you told me."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Attagirl. That's right. That's, uh, that's the truth. That's everything that we know."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Charlotte, You're free to go.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Great. Here we go. Hey, what the hell just happened in there?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby," Relax, they got nothing on you. They're bluffing. Kitty's alive. I just saw her in the back room. They just wanted to get you scared so you'd testify against Pop-Pop."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael," Unbelievable. Oh, that's great. You just told them the truth; they let us walk. Guess I owe you 50 bucks, huh?"
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Maeby," Yeah, I'd save your money. Kitty's got a lot of evidence, and she thinks that you tried to kill her, so you're probably going to need a better attorney."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Gardener's Daughter, Lo siento.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Michael, I hate Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, Tobias loses his security job trying to solve the store's mice problem, Lindsay, now without a job, goes with her initial instinct."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Buster," Mom, we're going to be late for practice."
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Narrator, ... and Annyong exacts his revenge.
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Buster, Where is everybody?
1,Not Without My Daughter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Not_Without_My_Daughter,Annyong," Heads up, fatty!"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,John Beard," Low-carb diets are sweeping the nation, but some local businesses are being left in the dust."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, Hey!
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,John Beard, And the latest on Iraq...
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," George Michael, they're gonna show that interview you did. We're gonna watch it on Thursday, okay? I'll make some popcorn."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George Michael," Popcorn? Really? Cool. Yeah, the hell with Atkins, huh?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Oh, yeah. Why blow it now? I'll fry up some bacon."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George Michael, Dad...
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Buddy, you got to take it easy, okay? I'm showing this as the model again. I don't want people to think we've got shoddy workmanship. That might not have been your fault."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., I know. Nothing works in this house.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, Tell me about it.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay, Is that a shot at me?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., Probably.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay," Because, for your information, I have a job."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, Really? What kind of job?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay, Beads!
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., Bees?!
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay, Beads.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., Beads?!
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, G.O.B.'s not on board.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay," Beads are very big right now-anklets, necklaces, you name it."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., Bracelets...
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay, But I'll need some startup money.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., I'm in. But we're gonna need a lot. Beads aren't cheap. Are beads cheap?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," G.O.B., shouldn't you be in bed?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B.," Well, I've got a meeting with Dad's attorney today. He's going to want me to take a lie detector test to use as evidence in Dad's trial, but I don't want to. What if they ask about a magic trick? I can't risk it."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, They're not going to ask you anything. They want me to take the polygraph test.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., But I'm the oldest. The matriarch if you will.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Oh, sure, I will."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Look, I have to do this to help out Dad, but you don't know anything about our business."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay," And, G.O.B., I'm not looking for a partner. And, believe me, if I was, it would not be you."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B.," Oh. Good. Well, I'll start my own business. How hard can it be? [Buzzes.] Bzz! We'll see who brings in more honey. [Buzzes.]"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, He's thinking about bees again.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Lindsay, I'm not going to just cut you a check so you can throw it away on another failed business."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay," Hey, ""Mommy, What Will I Look Like?"" should have worked."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, Lindsay had once started a photo-enhancing service which gave new parents a glimpse at what their infants would look like in half a century.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay," Hey, you put an ugly kid in, you can't be surprised when an ugly adult comes out."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay," Look, I need to become self-reliant. It's not going to last with Tobias. He's completely oblivious. He's got no idea how I'm feeling or thinking."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, So there's no sex?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay," I mean, how do you not have sex with me?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, It is a struggle.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," I'll tell you what... I'll help you out, but you got to work."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay," Great. Before you know it, I'll be in the red. And you can take that to the bank."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, I'm sure they'll contact me first.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, And that's when Michael got a call that made him wish he hadn't promised his sister the money.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, Hello. Kitty?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator," And later, the family waited for Michael at the prison meeting room..."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George, How do you make money from it?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., I don't know. Honey. Or just as gifts.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lucille, Who'd want a bee as a gift?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, ...while Buster and Annyong waited just outside.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Buster," Come on, just let me have one bite."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Annyong, No. Mother say no carbohydrate for you if you ever going to get girlfriend that's not old lady.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Buster, At least I can get a girlfriend.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Annyong, I can get a girlfriend before you.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Buster," (Chuckling.) Oh, we'll see about that."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Hey, why aren't you in there?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Buster," Oh, I was just keeping Annyong company."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Buster," Give me that bagel, you little piece of [bleep] Give it to me! [bleep]"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Barry, Our star witness. Come here. Good to see you. You know what? Don't get too close to me. 'Cause I've got an itch you can't believe. I think something laid eggs on me.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, Thanks for the heads up.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Barry, We've got your polygraph set up for tomorrow.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, About that...
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B.," I'll tell them, Michael. I won't do it. I'm afraid of what I might know."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George," You? No one wants you. Does anyone want him, Barry?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Barry, Who would want him?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lucille, They don't want you.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., Good.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, I might not be the best witness either. I got a call from Kitty this morning.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Barry, Your secretary?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George, My secretary.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, She says that she's got some evidence and she's threatening to bring down the company unless we meet her demands.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B.," Oh, that is just great. Now I'm expected to climb back on top of Kitty and do my thing again. I mean, this family runs into problems and it's ""Oh, let's have G.O.B. [bleep] our way out of it."""
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lucille, What is the matter with you?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," It's me that she wants to meet with me, G.O.B."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., Oh. Good.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Now what does she have, Dad? I need to know."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George," No, you can't know. We got to keep you nice and clean. Especially if you're going to take that lie detector test."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Barry, He is absolutely right.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George," Find out what Kitty wants and just give it to her. But don't find out what she knows. Michael, you can save this business. You are the only one who can do it."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B.," Yeah, besides me. But I kind of got my hands full with these babies."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Guard #2, He's got bees! No bees!
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lucille, They don't allow you to have bees in here.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, And business was slow at the banana stand when George Michael made a new friend.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Ann, Hi.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George Michael, Hi.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Ann, Are bananas high in carbohydrates?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George Michael," You're on Atkins, too? Yeah. Actually that's why I'm going to be on TV."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Ann, You are?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George Michael," I was interviewed for ""Hindsight"" with John Beard. I gave them a joke, but I don't know if they're gonna use it."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George Michael," Thanks to this diet craze, the last time we had a customer, the banana stand was still green."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,John Beard," Lose it. No, lose the whole kid. We'll just go with the Iraq piece."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Ann, That's so cool.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George Michael, I guess.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Ann, Do you want to watch it at my house?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George Michael," Yeah, I guess."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, And Michael headed off to meet Kitty. Their last meeting had ended poorly...
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Kitty," Say good-bye to your company, Michael. And say good-bye..."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," No, no, no, no."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, ...so Michael was understandably anxious about their reunion.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Guess I do get to see them again, huh?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Kitty," Can we please have one conversation that's not about my rack, Michael?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, Yeah.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Kitty," Maybe a better question would be ""What evidence do I have against you?"" Because I'm..."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," No, no, no, no, I don't want to know. I just want to know what you want."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Kitty, I'd like to be in charge of the Bluth Company.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Well, I want a hamburger and French fries, but I can't have the bun or the potatoes. Get real."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Kitty, I deserve it. Your father promised it to me on the day he went to prison.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Yeah, that sounds like something that he would do."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Kitty," And if I can't be in charge, then I'm going to have to tell the entire world that your father was building houses overseas without paying..."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Whoa, whoa... Stop, stop. Stop. No, finish. Finish. Without paying what? Taxes?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Kitty," Model houses, Michael. Overseas. And he hid it from the U.S. government."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," That's it, that's what my dad's been hiding, back taxes?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Kitty," And unless you plan on paying them, your dad's going to be in prison for a long time."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Well, we'll pay them. Forget it, we'll mortgage the company if we have to. We found money for those, we'll find money for taxes. Good to see you."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Kitty," Yeah. If I was in charge, that would've been my first move, too."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator," As Michael returned home, George Michael was heading out to meet the girl from the banana stand."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, Great news. The business is going to be okay.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George Michael," Yeah, I thought bananas would be okay on the diet."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," No, I meant... Well, you haven't been eating those have you?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George Michael, No. Just some nuts.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Yeah, those are fine. What I meant was I think we might be seeing Pop-Pop a little bit sooner than we thought. Does that sound good?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay, Do you hear that rattling?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Tobias, It is very worrisome.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, Hey! What the hell are you doing?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Tobias," Great news, Michael. We're thinking of purchasing a Bluth model home. And let's check the oven."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay, That doesn't inspire confidence.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Lindsay, the bead business taking off, is it?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Tobias," Actually, I am the breadwinner, Michael, as it turns out. I was walking in a strange place today... a place I'd never set foot in before."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator," Tobias, walking down a street he'd been down many times, saw a book he'd written years earlier as a psychiatrist. The book, initially unsuccessful, had suddenly caught fire... although strangely, only in the gay community."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Tobias," The book is huge. And I have a bit of money coming my way as a result. So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go upstairs and run the shower. Let me know if it's too loud in the kitchen. Okay."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," So, your husband comes into some money and suddenly he's not so oblivious anymore, huh?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay," This is not me being shallow, Michael. He's written a self-help book that's helping people. That does take some insight."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Listen, this better not mean you're blowing off the bead store."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay," Well, seeing as though you brought it up, maybe we should get out of this investment. I mean, seriously, Michael... beads?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," I knew you'd do this. You work for, like, three seconds and you find something that's easier, and you just grab it."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, It's Dip-a-Pet all over again.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, Lindsay also had a brief foray into what she had then hoped would be the burgeoning fad of custom pet coloring.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay," Well, that would've worked if you'd sprung for a bigger sink."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," George Michael, our show's about to start."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Maeby, He went out on his date.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, A date? But we had plans to... A date with who?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Maeby," Some girl. I mean, she barely has a face. You couldn't pick her out of a lineup of one."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,John Beard," ...but first, the palaces of Iraq. Trisha, tell us about these new mini-palaces of Saddam's you've discovered."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Trisha Thoon," Our troops have been living here for the last few days and, as you can tell, they've made themselves right at home. Now a lot of this damage is just due to shoddy workmanship. But the real surprise here is that these homes appear to be American built to begin with."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,John Beard," There have been sanctions against doing business with Hussein's regime since the early '90s, so who built them?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, Does that look a little like our kitchen island?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Trisha Thoon," Well, whoever it is, they're in a world of trouble."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, And Michael realized that his father's crimes might be bigger than he thought.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George, There's a good chance I may have committed some light treason.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Trisha Thoon, This might even be considered light treason.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Oh, my God."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator," Michael just found out his father might have committed some light treason by building model homes in Iraq. And he tried to get a hold of Kitty, who he knew had the evidence. Unfortunately, Kitty was meeting with G.O.B. at the time."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., What about hash browns?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Kitty," No, because hash browns are potatoes."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B.," So, you really can't eat anything on this diet. Wow, I wonder how this is going to affect my honey business."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Kitty," G.O.B., I have seen you get passed over, time and time again by your family. You don't deserve that, you're smarter than them."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., What about macaroni... let me finish... salad?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Kitty," G.O.B., this is your time. With my help, knowing what I know, we could take over the Bluth Company together."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B.," Wow, this is a side of you I'd never noticed before. Have they always been that big?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator," And the next day, Michael went to his mother's."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, I saw an expose on the Iraq palaces last night and I could've sworn that one of them was the Sea Wind unit.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lucille, That's funny. I always pictured Iraq in the middle of the desert.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Dad sold houses to the Iraqis, didn't he? This is what you kept from me so I could take the polygraph test. Tell me the truth, okay? 'Cause there's been a lot of lying in this family."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lucille, And a lot of love.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, More lies.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lucille," Look, I never knew about anything, but I had my suspicions. He never told me where he was going, but he used to come back from those business trips reeking of lamb. And people would send figs-not even at Christmas-in the middle of October. Oh, and once someone sent him a toe and he went white as a sheet. I think you're right, Michael."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B.," Zero hour, Michael. It's the end of the line. I'm the firstborn. I'm sick of playing second fiddle. I'm always third in line for everything. I'm tired of finishing fourth. Being the fifth wheel. There are six things I'm mad about, and I'm taking over."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, You want to be in charge?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., Yeah.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, You want to deal with what I deal with? A sister who takes your money and throws it away. A mother who you can't trust. A company whose founder may be on trial for treason. Is that what you want?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., What kind of vacation time does it offer?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, Yeah.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, G.O.B. realized that the power play he promised to make with Kitty had perhaps come at a bad time.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., I've made a huge mistake.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, And Tobias was having his first book reading.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Tobias," And for the ease of the reader, I have changed all the gender-related pronouns- ""he,"" ""she,""- to the masculine ""he."" ""The Man Inside Me. For Lindsay, my rock. I could not have done this without him."""
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, And Lindsay arrived to support her husband.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Tobias," ""...for there's a man inside me, and only when he's finally out, can I walk free of pain."""
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,James Alan Spangler, This book is going to sell like a billion copies.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Tobias," Lindsay. Oh, I'm so glad you came. I was hoping for more women. Perhaps I shouldn't have just used ""he."""
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, And Lindsay realized that Tobias was just as oblivious as she'd always thought.

1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Tobias, What are you talking about? We've had some great times.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay," We've got nothing left, Tobias."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, And Michael went to confront his father.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, You're building houses in Iraq? Do you know how they punish treason?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George, First time.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, I've never heard of a second.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George," Oh, I've got the worst [bleep]ing attorneys."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George," This is why I didn't want to get you involved, but we can fix this. But what are Kitty's demands? What does she want?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," She wants my job. Now, suddenly, everybody wants my job. I should have given it to her."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George," You mean you didn't? Michael, she has the evidence of what we did over there."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, All she thinks it is is unpaid taxes.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George," Yeah, but what if she gives it to somebody who's even moderately intelligent?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator," In fact, Kitty had gone to someone moderately intelligent in her continuing quest for control of the Bluth Company."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Buster, I can't believe you called me for a date.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Kitty," You didn't tell anyone, did you?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Buster," Are you kidding? I don't need to brag, but some people haven't even been on a date."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Annyong," Date's not over yet, fatty."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George," You weren't thinking clearly. I mean, none of us are. We need bread."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," If this information was so damaging, why didn't you just shred it?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George," Well, Saddam owed us money."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, And you didn't realize that he wouldn't pay?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George, You mom had a good feeling about him.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," So Mom knew this entire time and she just lied to my face for months and months? Tell me something, Dad. This is, this is your problem, okay? Not mine."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George," Well, maybe it wouldn't be my a problem if you did what I asked you to for once in your damn life and you gave Kitty what I asked you to."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Once in my damn life? All I've ever done my entire life is do exactly what you told me to do, all right? I've done everything for this family, Pop. Not anymore. Kitty can have my job. And you can take your own polygraph test, 'cause I'm done. I'm done with you and I'm done with the business."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George, That's great. I'm going to get a lethal injection because my son won't eat a potato.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator," George, in a surprise move, volunteered to take a polygraph."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Barry," So, did you swipe a sedative from the infirmary?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George, No.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Barry, Are you lowering your heart rate?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George," No. It's okay. I want to do this because I want people to know that I never willfully deceived anyone. Mistakes were made but I never intended to hurt anyone. I was just trying to support my family. But I can see clearly now, sitting in this chair, strapped in this machine I can see that my life has become a failure. I've let people down. I've let myself down. But I love my country."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lucille, What is he doing?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George, I love it here. You can shop. I love my country. I can't breathe.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Polygraph Technician, I'm taking him off this thing.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,D.A.," Wait, wait. Are you guilty? Yes or no?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Polygraph Technician, I think he's having a heart attack. That was not a nod.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,D.A., It was a nod.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Polygraph Technician, No.

1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Polygraph Technician, It was not a nod.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lucille, Call an ambulance.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator," George Sr. was raced to the hospital, and his family soon gathered around."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay, How is he?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lucille, Stable. But they don't know if he's due for another one. It's his own fault. What kind of diet is this? It's too much meat. I want all of you off this immediately. (To Lindsay.) Except you.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay, Tobias. I can't believe you came.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Tobias," Come on, Lindsay-this is my family."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, And Lindsay realized that perhaps they did have something left. A real connection.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Tobias," Also, Dale, one of the gentlemen from my reading, is a nurse here, so we were able to park right out front."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay," Oh, Barry, did you talk to a doctor?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Barry, I did. I have poison oak. Do you believe it? How the hell did I get that?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lucille, She was talking about George.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Barry," Oh, he's the same. Look, I guess we should decide on who's going to speak for the family. I would, but I have Laker tickets."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, Buster knew this was his chance to put Kitty's coup d'etat in action. He wondered if he was up for it.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Barry," Someone might have to sign the ""Do Not Resuscitate"" form."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, And he decided he wasn't.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Buster, I need to make a telephone call.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B.," I'm in charge now. I speak for this family. I mean... I could if you wanted me to. I'd rather not, obviously. Don't know what I'd say. Why do I have to be the one? I don't need this. Why does this have to become my problem? No, I'm out. Forget it. Find somebody else. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of doing everything for this family."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Barry, Where is Michael?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., Typical.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay, Did somebody call him?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator," In fact, they hadn't, and at the moment, he was determined to finally get as far away from his family as possible."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Hey, pal. Pack your bags."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George Michael, Where we going?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, Anywhere. Joshua Tree. Space Camp. The Baseball Hall of Fame. Everything you and I have always wanted to do but haven't been able to because of this ridiculous family.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George Michael, We're just going to go?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Yeah, and I don't know if we're even going to come back. There's nothing keeping us here."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George Michael," Well, Dad... I like it here."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," What the hell is going on with you lately? I wanted to watch, uh... Hindsight, and, and you weren't there. I want to pack up and desert the family and-and you don't want to. Is it this new girlfriend?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George Michael," No... It's because of the family. I like the family. I mean, if we leave, who's gonna take care of these people?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, I don't know. The state or the police. Maybe the Magician's Alliance will pick up some slack. No. Hey. That's gonna be them and they're gonna want something. We're not answering.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George Michael, Hello?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Annyong, Where's George Michael?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Maeby," Exactly. Where is he? Ever since he's been dating this Annie McNoface, he's been blowing me off."

1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Maeby, Room 212.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, And that's when Maeby decided that perhaps she could use her uncle to make her cousin jealous.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,George Michael," Hey, Dad, wait up."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Maeby, That was a waste of time.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, How's he doing?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Dr. Fishman, He's hanging in there. He keeps trying to get this IV out of his arm. I don't understand why. It's just glucose.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, We're all trying to stay away from sugar.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lindsay," He's going to be okay- right, Michael?"
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, Absolutely. Absolutely. You all right?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B.," I'll handle this one, Michael. Don't you worry. It will take a lot more than a heart attack to kill that old bear. Old bear! He likes the honey. He never got a chance to see my bee business take off."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Come on, now, Dad's going to be around another 30 years, G.O.B. Your business, uh, might not."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B.," You're a good brother, Michael. Heart attack never stopped old Big Bear."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Buster, I didn't even know we were calling him Big Bear.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., We never had a chance to.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Hey, hey. Come on, G.O.B. Everybody, I'm, I'm very sorry. Okay? I-I feel awful. I should have been here. I'm the one that was supposed to take that polygraph test and then I just turned on him, then this happened. But never again. Okay? I will never ever leave this family no matter what."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lucille, You should have been here.

1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lucille," Well, you didn't say it."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, I feel awful. I should have been here.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Maybe you're right, maybe I didn't say it. I should have been here."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Dr. Fishman," Excuse me, Mr. Bluth. We lost him. He just, uh... got away from us. I'm sorry."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, Can we go in there?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Dr. Fishman, If you want. Not a lot to see.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael," Maybe not for you, but for us..."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator," And that's when the family realized that George Sr. wasn't dead, but was fleeing the country that he loved so very much."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Michael, Pack your bags.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator," On the next season of Arrested Development, the family grapples with the news they had just heard..."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., Why would a doctor say he's gone when he means he's escaped?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Lucille," Oh, God, I've missed bread."
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,G.O.B., What'd you say? He leapt out the window.
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Narrator, ...Maeby's life gets a little more complicated...
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Maeby, I mean it's so obvious. He gave himself a shot to make it look like he was having a heart attack. How could they not see that?
1,Let 'Em Eat Cake,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Let_%27Em_Eat_Cake,Annyong, Maybe we should kiss again to teach them a lesson about obvious.

2,The One Where They Build a House,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_One_Where_They_Build_a_House,Michael, How's this for a business model? We make the company look like it's in the black by starting construction on the Phase Two development. I know what you're thinking- we're not in the black. How are we going to build 30 houses without any money? We don't. We build one. Then we have a huge ribbon-cutting ceremony while we're raising the funds for the others.
2,The One Where They Build a House,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_One_Where_They_Build_a_House,Narrator," Michael's father always unveiled his construction projects with a highly-publicized ribbon-cutting ceremony.

2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, Yeah.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B., Uh-oh. He's going to think I was coming on to him.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B., You've got a nice mouth.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B., I'd kill for that ass.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B.," Okay, the chair's not doing it now, but lately it's been giving out as soon as I lean back."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B.," Anyway, I was talking about Poof magazine. The magazine for magicians."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, Yeah.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B.," Look, this guy Tony Wonder bakes himself into a loaf of bread, and then pops out of a giant sandwich to feed the troops. I had that idea ten months ago."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, You had that idea?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B.," Well, basically. I was going to boil myself alive into a chowder and then be ladled into a giant cauldron to entertain and feed the firemen."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, It's pretty close.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B., I should be in this Poof!
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, Michael Bluth.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lucille, He found him. Ice found your father.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator, Michael had recently hired a bounty hunter to track down his fugitive father.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, What? Where?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lucille,"00 to tell us, but he wants to get paid first."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," Oh, Dad goes back to jail, I can be cleared, I could be President again."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B., And I'm halfway to getting out of this office and into a steaming bowl of soup.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, Everybody wins.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B., Yeah.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lucille," Oscar, close it! You look like the window of a butcher shop. Thank God, I can finally get rid of him."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael,"00, Mom."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator, Michael then headed down to the frozen banana stand where his son was supposed to be working.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Ann," It just seems like every time we want to be together, your father..."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," Hey, guys. What's going on? Why is the banana stand closed?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael," Oh, Ann came to see me, so I thought I'd take a little break. Can we talk about this later?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," Sure, no problem. Just... let's keep the phone on, okay, pal? Great. Hey, you!"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Ann, See? That's a perfect example of how your father always interrupt...
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, I'm sorry. Hello?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," Hey, buddy, they found your grandfather. That's what I wanted to tell you."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael," Yeah, that's great."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, I didn't want to say that before when you were talking to Egg.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, I'm actually still talking with Ann.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," Oh, she's still going, huh? All right, great. Listen. I'll talk to you later. I'm very excited."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, That's good.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Ann, I think we should break up.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator, The bounty hunter meanwhile was eager to impress the family attorney.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Barry, I cannot believe that you made these.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator, party planning. And Lindsay was still hoping to score a date with him.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lindsay," I don't suppose you'd be interested in catering an ""affair"" with me."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Ice," Well, when you get a full guest list, let me know."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lindsay, Why can't I do this anymore?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Maeby," That's got to bother you, huh, Dad? I mean, she's flirting right in front of you."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Tobias," Hmm? Oh. No. I am surprised, though, that she's going after somebody so similar to my own type, hmm. But I suppose we all do expose our inner desires, don't we?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Maeby, I think you just did.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Tobias," No, I didn't."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Maeby, Is there any way I can divorce them?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Barry," Oh, sure. It's called emancipation. But you've got to prove that you're living in an unstable environment."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Maeby, Both my parents are trying to have affairs. Of course they haven't succeeded yet.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Barry," If they do, I could have you out of this house, on the street in a month."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Maeby, Sweet.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Barry, Mm-hmm.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator, Soon Michael arrived and Ice began his presentation.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Ice," When word got out that he was building houses for Saddam Hussein, he escaped to Mexico, where as you know, he was arrested, and interred in a local prison until he was killed by this guard. His body was held for six days within the prison walls, when..."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, I'm sorry. Sorry... he killed a guard?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Ice," No, the guard killed him. He's dead. Buried in Mexico."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," Hold on, how do we know this is true?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Ice," Because I have here his dental records, his death certificate... and a political cartoon from a leading Mexican publication."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Ice," Okay... again, I'm a caterer, so if you do have any family events- weddings, wakes... I'll leave my card."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lucille, Is it true? Is he really gone?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Oscar, Ow.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lucille, Just checking.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lindsay, These are his teeth. He had such perfect teeth. It was that Glisten.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B., He swore by that Glisten.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lindsay," I can still hear him now. ""Who left the cap off my bleeping Glisten?"""
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lucille," It's all hitting me now. This is really happening. All this awful funeral stuff. The will, we have to get the will. I don't know if enough time has passed. I don't know what I'm saying. Is it in your car, Barry? I'm going to throw up! Check the car, Barry. I don't know what I'm saying!"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Barry," The will is not here, the will is at my office next to the hot plate with the frayed wires. I didn't, uh..."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," In fact, Barry had lost George Sr.'s will."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Barry," ...how did I get here? Oh, my God, Lucille, he is gone."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Maeby, We have to have a wake.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," Maeby was upset, but saw a chance to fix up her mother."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Maeby," I don't know, maybe we can get Ice to cater it or something. I don't know what I'm saying."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lindsay, We don't even have a body.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B., I will be my father's body. I will be the one buried. Because he loved magic so very much.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, I don't think G.O.B. knows what he's saying.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B.," I know exactly what I'm saying. I will be buried in my father's place, and then one week later I will emerge from the grave in one of the greatest illusions ever."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, This is all about getting into Poof?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B.," I mean, how does that not get me a cover?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lucille, We can't tell him about this.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Oscar, I think the boy's been lied to enough.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lucille," You weren't here for the parakeet, Oscar."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," As a child, Buster had a beloved parakeet who, after landing on their housekeeper Rosa's wig, flew away when she took out the trash... and into a transformer. When Buster found out, he destroyed the family's kitchen- believing this to be where Rosa lived."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Buster, Whoa.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lucille, What are you doing home?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Buster, The Army had half a day. Are you guys planning a party?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Oscar," Yes, it's your father's birthday. Which coincidentally is my birthday."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Buster," Because you're twins. Well, I've got some shopping to do."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," George Michael, meanwhile, had just been broken up with by his first girlfriend and was on his way home and he went to his father for comfort."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, Dad?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, I've got some bad news.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael," What? What, is Ann telling everyone?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," It's your grandfather. Apparently, he's dead."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, Are you okay?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Uh, sorry. What were you saying about Ann?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator, George Michael didn't want to burden his father with his breakup.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, Nothing. I just... I broke up with her. It's no big deal.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, Really? Are you okay?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, Me? I'm great.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, Mm-hmm. Yeah?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, I'm great.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, Good. Yeah. She wasn't for us.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael," No, she's a great girl."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, For those other guys.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, You think there are other guys?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, I don't know what I'm saying. Come here.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Buster," Hey, brother. You wanted to see me?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B.," Buster, yeah. I need you to help me with this illusion that I'm working on."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Buster," Oh, for Dad's birthday?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B.," Yeah. Dad's birthday. So, look, I'm going to get in this coffin. And what I'm going to need you to do is to spin it around to show everybody that there's no trap door. Then I'm going to escape out the trap door. You close the trap door. Bring in the pallbearers and bury an empty box."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Buster," So, it's a hoax. But why are you doing a coffin trick on Dad's birthday?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B.," Black humor. Say, ""Hey, Dad. Look at you. You're a year older... and a year closer to death."""
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Buster," Oh, yeah, I guess that's kind of funny. Okay, but you have to do a favor for me. I'm not really in the Army. And I told Mom I was, but I can't go to a family event without an Army uniform."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B.," Oh, yeah. I used to be a stripper."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Buster, Strippers don't wear clothes.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B., Not at the end of the show.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Buster," You mean, you can wear stripper clothes when you're not stripping?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B., You tell me.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator, George Michael went for a walk in the adjoining lot to grieve both losses in private. And he made an interesting discovery.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, Pop-Pop?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George, Hide me. Don't turn in Pop-Pop. Help Pop-Pop.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator, George Michael snuck his grandfather into the attic and helped clean him up.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, They're perfect.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George," Years of brushing with Glisten. Listen, uh... you can't tell anybody I'm up here. You have to protect me."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael," Yeah, I know. I can't not tell my father."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George, I'm your grandfather. And I went through hell to get here.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," He had. After being arrested, he found a loophole in the Mexican judicial system."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George, I have money.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator, The Mexican authorities even attempted to fake his funeral. Although it was a less than perfect deception.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George, Anyway... I was out and halfway down to Panama and I saw something in a local paper.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator, What he saw was a story about his wife giving mouth-to-mouth to a homeless man. But he knew the truth. She was kissing his brother.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael," I understand what that feels like. I was dumped today. And the bad part is, I can't even tell my dad how upset I am about it, because he'll think that I should just be upset about you."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George, He wouldn't be wrong.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, Well...
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George," Seems like we're going through the same thing. I don't know, why don't we keep each other's secrets?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, Yeah. Okay.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George," Listen, if you pass a mini-mart, Pop-Pop gets a treat?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," And the next morning, Michael ran into his son doing something suspicious."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, Morning.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, Hi.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, Where are you going with that food?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, I was just going to... eat some of my grandfather's favorite foods in my room. That's the form that my grief is taking.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, I think George Michael is hiding Ann in the attic.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lindsay," From who, the Nazis?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," No, his girlfriend. From me. I just caught him sneaking up to her in the attic. And he clearly did so because he thinks I don't approve. You know, I think I'm going to invite her to the wake. Why make him hide? Why do to him what...? Why do to him what Dad used to do to me?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lindsay, He was so amazing!
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," That was actually an example of how not so amazing he was. Boy, you're really going through something here, huh?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lindsay," I know! You know, it's funny, all those years when I pretended to cry I used to use Dad's death to get me going. I tried it with Mom's but I'd just end up smiling and ruining it."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lindsay," But it feels, like, real, you know? You haven't really allowed yourself to grieve much at all, Michael."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," My relationship with Dad was much more, uh, much more complicated than yours. It was predicated a lot on secrets and lies. There wasn't a whole lot of, uh, trust there, you know?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lindsay, Mm-hmm.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Tobias," Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne. ""I'm not going to cry about my Pa. I'm going to build an airport- put my name on it."" Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? You can keep them bottled up, but they will come out, Michael. Sometimes in the most unexpected... Hey, where the [bleep] are my hard-boiled eggs?!"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," G.O.B., meanwhile, was preparing for the illusion of being buried alive."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B.," Boy, you sure got this hole dug out quick."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," In fact, the laborer had been hired by George, Sr. three days earlier for the same hole. And Buster searched for the perfect card."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Buster," ""Someone wanted to send you a birthday greeting... See you..."" Oh, that is wicked. "
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," And soon, the wake that Ice had catered began."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Maeby, What are you doing? Is this what you're wearing?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lindsay," My father's dead, Maeby."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Maeby," Yeah, but you're not. And Ice is right there."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," Maeby knew that if she could get her mother to have an affair, she could emancipate."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Maeby, All Pop-Pop ever wanted was to see you with another man besides Daddy.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lindsay," You're right. You know what? I'm going to throw on a skirt, take off my underwear and make your Pop-Pop proud."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Maeby, Wait a minute. Let me ask Barry. That might be enough right there.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George," Is Oscar wearing my suit? Hey, you tell my brother you don't wear dead man's pants. Shame on him. And you say that to him. You say, you say, ""Shame on you."""
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, Okay.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George, Say it to me like you're going to say it to him.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, I'm probably not going to say it to him.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George, Okay. Look at her. Look at her down there. Does she look sad to you?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael," Oh, my God, that's Ann."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George, Who?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, It's the girl who ripped my heart out. The girl whose face will always be etched in my mind.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George, Her?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, She's really funny.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George," Well, let's hope so. Don't forget the chicken wings."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," Hey, Ann. You're here. That's great. I wasn't sure whether you got my message."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Ann, It wasn't a message. We talked.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, Ann... did dad invite you?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," I just figured life's too short. You two seem to care for each other. Why throw that away, huh? Huh? Okay."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, You think we really do?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," A father can tell, okay? It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," And Buster arrived, dressed in the military outfit G.O.B. had procured for him."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, What the hell are you wearing?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Buster," It's all regulation, Michael. To get the top right, the pants had to be a little snug. Is there a birthday gift pile, hmm?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, A birthday gift pile?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator, Michael recalled what Buster did to what he thought was Rosa's car with what he thought was Rosa's favorite toy.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, Yours is the first.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Buster, And the most wicked. (Giggles.)
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lucille, Get him out of here. We can't let him know it's a wake.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B.," Buster, let's go get that coffin ready to be buried."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," And so the family gathered to remember George, Sr."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," If anyone would like to say anything about Dad, now's the time. Anyone? Anyone? Perhaps my son, George Michael would like to say something. Huh? Want to share your feelings? It's okay to cry, pal. It's okay."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael," Yeah? Wow. He's really gone. But you know, I think that if he was here right now, I would probably tell him that it all worked out. And that, um, I'll be bringing you some salmon rolls right away. In heaven."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George, How many times I got to tell this kid chicken wings?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator, Lindsay got up to speak in an outfit her daughter had chosen.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lindsay, My father meant the world to me.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Maeby," Wipe, Mom. Give it a wipe."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George, That's a home run.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," And finally, Michael got up to speak."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, I had a very complicated relationship with my father.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, Ice? Can you just cool it on that smoothie for right now?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George, There are smoothies?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," I could never trust my father, but I always want my son to be able to trust me. So, from now on, we're always going to be honest with each other, okay? 'Cause there's nobody I love more than you in this whole world."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B.," Michael, listen, can we move the eulogy outside, so I can time being lowered into Dad's grave with your big finish?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, I'm done.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B.," Wow, that was your eulogy? Glad Dad wasn't around to see that."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, That was great.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," Well, I meant it. So no more secret trips up to the attic, right?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," George Michael didn't want to betray his grandfather, but it appeared that his father already knew the truth."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, I have Pop-Pop in the attic.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," What? The mere fact that you call making love ""Pop-Pop"" tells me you're not ready."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B., Hey! Before we lose the sun!
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B.," The speeches we heard today we nothing more than words, but I will prove that I love my father more than anybody. Buster! Buster! As you can see, this is a normal coffin. Take me halfway around. I will become my dead father's body as I'm lowered into his grave. All right, spin it back around."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Buster, Dead father? Is dad... dad's dead?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B.," Just keep it together, Buster and spin this back around."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Buster," Oh, my God, the card! The card!"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,G.O.B., Something's gone wrong.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator, Michael noticed something in the dirt.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," ""Glisten."""
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator, And suddenly he realized what his son meant when he said he had Pop-Pop in the attic.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, Dad? Dad?!
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George," How you doing, Michael? Hey, but your father's alive. Michael, he's, he's alive."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, How could you do this to us?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George," Well, you see, I had no choice. My brother is with Lucille, you see. She's destroying the family."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," You put the entire business in peril, you escaped from prison, and then you make us all think that you've died?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George," I'm an innocent man, Michael. I'm, I'm, I'm a patsy here. I signed some documents. I thought they were going to kill me. Don't turn me in, okay? Can you help me out?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," And for a moment, Michael was conflicted."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," Well, I'm not going to let you stay here and make my son an accomplice, okay? I'm sorry. I'm not going to let you spread your guilt to him."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Maeby," Ice, my mother has something to tell you."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lindsay, I find you very attractive.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Maeby," And she cleans up nice, too. Trust me."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Ice, I think I'm finally off the clock.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Maeby," I'm out of here, right?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," Uh, Dad's alive. He's hiding in the attic. In the atti...?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Buster, He's upstairs?
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Ice, He's gone. Stack the chafing dishes outside by the mailbox. I'm on the job.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Lindsay, I can't seem to give this away.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Barry, I can't believe it. And I just found the will.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George," Thanks, Mikey."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," Yeah. Well, now it's our secret."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," And Michael met up with his son, their roles now reversed."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, Hi.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael," I'm sorry. You know, from now on, we'll just tell the truth to each other."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, We're going to try.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, Yeah.
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," So wait. Obviously, Ann wasn't in the attic, so you actually did break up with her?"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael," Actually, she broke up with me. But the great thing is, that she was so moved by what you said tonight that we're back together."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael, Ah!
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,George Michael, Yeah!
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," Oh, is that great! Well, we're family and we stick together, huh? Hmm. Okay. Let's go dig up your uncle."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, Buster finds out about the death of Captain Kangaroo, Michael grows weary of caring for his father, ..."
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Michael," No, Pop-Pop does not get a treat. I just brought you a bleeping pizza!"
2,Good Grief,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Good_Grief,Narrator, ... and G.O.B. finally makes the cover of Poof magazine.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," It was Monday morning, and Michael Bluth was nervous about meeting with the new prosecutor of his father's criminal case."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lucille," I don't know what you're so nervous about, Michael. It's a new prosecutor. It's a whole new beginning. A new day, a new case, a whole new set of lies."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," I'm not lying anymore, Mom."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," Michael was lying. He found his fugitive father earlier in the week, and he was hiding him in the attic, where George, Sr. was currently waiting for his breakfast."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, About the business- just for the record- I was not involved with Dad building houses in Iraq. That's exactly what I'm going to tell them.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lucille," Is that for Lindsay? Because she's not scared to eat in front of me anymore. Those are the whites only, yes?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, These aren't for Lindsay. These are mine.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lucille," Anyway, I'm not lying anymore either, Michael. I'm being lied... on."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," Wow, now more is going to come up than go down."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Oscar, I got to get out of here.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Hmm?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Oscar, I can't take this anymore. She's just so... loving and affectionate. I-I... this is not the woman I fell in love with.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," Oscar, please. You can't go. You got to stay, okay? This is the nicest she's been since she found out that Rosa could breast-feed Buster."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Oscar," Oh, Buster- don't even bring that up. He's well into his Army training."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," Actually, Buster had hit a wall in his Army training."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Buster," I can't do it; I can't make my bed, and I can't do this, either- I'm sorry. Aren't you supposed to yell at me and call me ""homo"" and motivate me over this wall?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Sergeant Baker, We can't do that anymore. Lawsuit.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," In fact, it was a recent ruling, prosecuted by the same man who Michael was soon to meet with."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,James Alan Spangler," It's going to be a long time before Sergeant Baker Wendell Baker calls someone ""Private Homo"" again."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Oscar," God willing, he'll fail boot camp."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," Well, why wouldn't he? He already failed day camp."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Oscar, Hey.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael," Hey. Hey, Dad, you ready for the prosecutor?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, I-I hope so. How'd that math test work out?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael," Oh, it was okay, I guess, but I don't know. It was weird; I studied with Ann, but I still got a B-minus."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Ann got you a B-minus?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael," Well, it wasn't Ann. She's an expert in math. Isn't that cute?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Is it?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, Michael felt his son was setting the bar too low with his dating standards.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael," No, it wasn't Ann's fault. You know, I think I just ended up thinking about the-the questions too long, and then by the time I put an answer down, I went with, like, my fifth choice or something like that."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," Oh, George Michael, never settle for fifth choice. Something better is going to come along. She just has to."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael," I think maybe sitting in the back of the class with Ann is a bad idea. You know, she's just so pretty... I get distracted, I guess."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Do you?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael, I wish I could draw her nose.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Maybe it's your eyes. Maybe you need glasses. For your grades. Didn't you say you had a hard time reading the board sitting in back?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael," No, I said I was in the back of the classroom, but still, no, no..."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," Yeah, that's what I mean, yeah?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael," Well, I don't know, maybe."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," No, definitely. I'll call the eye doctor. I'm going to set you up an appointment. Okay?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Tobias," Hey, gang."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Tobias.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Tobias," Oh, ooh... I'm afraid I'll have to take 'em to go. I'm late for the gym. Oh, and also, here's the number in case the Blue Man Group calls and needs an understudy. I just found out that my cellular telephone was a lemon. It didn't work."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay," Coincidentally, neither do you."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Pretty brave card for you to play.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay, I just can't stand it- Tobias staying in shape for a bunch of slutty gym rats.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, What's wrong with your voice?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay, Nothing. I've been going out.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," Lindsay had been frnquenting singles clubs, also still hoping to make her open marriage work..."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay, Woo!
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, ...which it won't.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Man #3, I didn't catch that.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay, Woo!
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay," I wonder how many women he's slept with, if any."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," Lindsay, it's not a competition."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay," Of course it is, Michael. That's why they call it ""scoring."""
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Maybe in the '70s.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay, That many? We've only been doing this for a month.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," You know, instead of competing with Tobias, why don't you try just spending a little bit more time with your daughter?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay, Why? Tobias doing that?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," At that moment, Lindsay's daughter Maeby was in the process of wooing her own man."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby, Who is it?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Steve Holt, Steve Holt!
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, Maeby had even started ordering unnecessary items just to have more occasions to see him.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Steve Holt," Uh, you ordered a ""Memories of Thanksgiving"" basket?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby," Wow, that looks great."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay," Maeby, who's your friend?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Steve Holt, Is this your sister?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay, No... but you just made my day.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby, Thank you for the basket. See you.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay, He thinks I'm cute.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby, He's 19. He's a senior at my high school.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, And had been for several years.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay, You know what? I think I am going to spend more time with my daughter.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, I can't promise you I won't tell the prosecutor about that.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George, Where you been?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Are you wearing my dead wife's maternity clothes?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George, Yeah. It's the only thing I could find. Where are the eggs?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Doctor says they're bad for the baby.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George," So, you ready for this new prosecutor?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," Well, I was, until you came back."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George," Hey, you're not going to turn me in, are you? Because I had no idea there were sanctions against, uh, I-Iraq. You know, they-they sent me over there. They said, ""Go build."" I-I... Do I look like a criminal mastermind to you? How do you get this ham open? I can... I can't get this ham open."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," I'm not going to turn you in, Dad, but you have put me in a position where I'm going to have to lie. Why'd you have to come back here in the first place?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George," Oh, no reason- your mother happens to be just shtupping my brother, that's all. I'm only here to find out if I have a shot with her. If she's really in love with Oscar, I don't know, to hell with her- I'll just... I'll just leave. I'll never come back."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Great. She's really in love with him.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George, That's very funny.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Mm.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George," I need you to find out, okay? 'Cause ever since I-I heard about this, I can't... sleep, I can't... I can't eat. Oh. Oh, look, it just peels off. Isn't that clever?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," Later that day, George Michael was having his eye exam... and finding it to be just as difficult as his math exam."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Optometrist, One or two?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael," Two. No, no, one."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Optometrist," Okay, two... or three?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael," Three. Unless three is too much of an improvement. I'm sorry, is one... is one in the mix still?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," And Michael met with the new prosecutor, Wayne Jarvis."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," I'm sorry, I don't understand how this is not a conflict of interest. I mean, you almost represented us, and now you're the prosecutor?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis, The Patriot Act. Read it.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, I'm not even the president anymore. My brother G.O.B. is.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis, I spoke with G.O.B. He appears to know nothing.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," Yeah, that's not an act. He's twice tried to microwave a Ding Dong while it was still in its foil... twice."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis, Twice?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Two times.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," In fact, G.O.B. had been grilled earlier."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,G.O.B.," I don't know anything about the business, I told you!"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis," We're going to get you, Bluth. We'll give you a few minutes to think about what you want to do. [To Cho] He knows less than anyone we have ever questioned."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," G.O.B. knew too little to know that, however, and his confidence had never been more shaken. And just when he thought he couldn't handle another embarrassment..."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis, You're free to go.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis," Things could get very messy for you, Michael, unless you have something to bargain with, like, say... a fugitive."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, I don't know where to find such a thing.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis," Well, look harder. There might be something in it for you."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Something to get me off the hook?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis, If you can find a certain someone.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Barry," Can I have a moment alone with my client, please? [To Michael] Did you follow any of that?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," Yeah, he's hinting that he's going to grant me immunity, but only on the condition that I turn in my father."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Barry, Do you know where your father is?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, Michael had just found out that his legal problems might go away if he turned in his father.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Barry," It's just you and me now, huh?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," No, Barry, I... I know where my father is, okay? He came back to make sure that my mother was really in love with my uncle. He wants to know if he's still got a shot with her. If he doesn't, he's leaving."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Barry," Well, if he's got a shot with her, just give me a little tap on the fanny."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, It's not going to happen.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Barry," Okay, then look, just tell him anything he wants to hear to keep him from running. We just have to keep him here until we can hear what kind of deal they're offering you. You just trust me. I'm a lot more competent than you can imagine. Oh, I forgot to take the tinfoil off, too. I really wanted that."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," Buster, meanwhile, was sharing his failure with someone who was well versed on the subject."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Buster," I mean, I couldn't get over the wall. They put me on suspension until I can."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," Well, perhaps you need to find somebody who can motivate you."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Buster," Yeah, but who?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, And then it hit him.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, G.O.B. had always proven a good motivator for Buster.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Young G.O.B., Do it!
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Young Buster, Uhh!
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Young G.O.B.," Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Young Buster," Thanks, brother."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Buster," Hey, brother. How would you like to, uh, go to the old playground with me?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,G.O.B., I'm sure as hell not going back to work. I'm never going back there.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Tobias," Oh, well, then perchance I might be able to borrow your cellular telephone?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,G.O.B.," I'm not fit to run a company, and I don't deserve a fancy phone."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Tobias," Well, the Blue Man Group might need me, and I do deserve a fancy phone."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," They didn't, and he doesn't."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," Michael knew he couldn't let his father get away, so he decided to see if his mother and Oscar really were in love."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," So, come on, aren't you really just dating Oscar to get back at Dad?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lucille," Um, it may have started as that, but I have fallen in love with Oscar. And it's so nice not to have to worry about getting pregnant. The doctor said I couldn't be a mother now if I tried."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, And that was without even interviewing me.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lucille, a hot-tee.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Oscar, Stop me from pouring this on myself. I can't take this anymore.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," Okay, all right, now, listen, Oscar, maybe you should think about moving on, you know? I mean, this really isn't your scene- the sweaters and the furniture. Maybe you should take a leap at freedom like my father, just run. Is that her rape horn?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Oscar, It's more like a starter's pistol.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Run.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," Meanwhile, Tobias set about learning..."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Tobias," Oh, there we go."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, ...how to operate his new cell phone.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Tobias, Oh!
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, And Lindsay tried to spend more time getting to know her daughter.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay," Hi, Maeby. Oh, Steve, hi."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Steve Holt, Hi.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby, What are you doing here?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay," I thought I'd spend a little time with my daughter. After all, hasn't been that long since I've been in high school. Is that a fire?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby, We have to go to class.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay," Okay. Well, uh, this was fun. Maybe later we can all spend a little more time together, go shopping, get a drink."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby," I'm in school, and I'm 15."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay," Oh, well, I'm much, much, much older than 15."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Steve Holt, You don't look it.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay," Oh, Steve. He thinks I'm young. You made my day again! (Laughing hoarsely.)"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Steve Holt," Wow, your Mom's pretty, uh, out there."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby, She's not my mom.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Steve Holt, But she said you were her daughter.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby, His daughter. That's my dad.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Steve Holt, That's a dude?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby, And the worst part is he thinks he's passing.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Steve Holt, Whoa.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," Right outside the school, Buster tried to put his own plan into action by stirring up old memories."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Buster," So, what do you say? I need your help to get over the wall. Push me."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,G.O.B.," I'm the pathetic one, Buster, not you. I totally freaked out in front of that prosecutor today. Like a little girl. In a little dress. Little saddle shoes. Little pigtails."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Buster," Wow, that does sound like a little girl. Come on. Get my ire up! Push me! Oh. Oh, this is turning out to be much more fun than I'd hoped."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," It was fun, but it wasn't making him a better soldier."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Buster, Push me higher. Whoo. I'll do it. Whoo!
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, And Michael reported to his father about his meeting with the prosecutor.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George, Prosecutor offer you a deal?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," That was not said, but, uh, more importantly, you should know that it seems like Oscar's on his way out."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George, Really?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," Yeah, so just sit tight, and everything should be fine."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George," Wow. Hey, by the way, I broke this thing. What the hell is it, anyway?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," That's a breast pump, Dad."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George," Oh, well, I did not use it for that."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," And so, Michael went to meet the prosecutor."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis, I felt obligated to share some photographs with you. I obtained these from the Bluth Company email server.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, You tapped into our email? That's legal?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Barry, I'm going for a hot Ding Dong. Hot Ding Dong? Yeah?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis," Michael, this is a close-up satellite photograph of the Iraqi countryside. See this little series of hills around that stream? Those are bunkers. We believe that those bunkers contain weapons of mass destruction. We also think that your father was building on that land to hide them, which is why that photograph was on his email."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Are you serious?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis, Almost always. I was once called the worst audience participant Cirque du Soleil ever had.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, This is a big accusation.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis," Well, Michael, I did not find their buffoonery amusing."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, About my father.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis," He's guilty, Michael, of medium to heavy treason. That proves it, and you can't protect him. Turn him in, and immunity is yours."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, Michael returned home to confront his father.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay, Mom was up here looking for you. She's claiming Oscar's disappeared because of something you said to him.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, I can't talk right now.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay, Really? What's wrong with your voice?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, I can talk- sure. I didn't say anything to Oscar. Anything else?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay," No. Oh, hey, did I tell you I accidentally ran into Steve Holt?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Steve Holt, Wow. Everything about you is so womanly. You're everything a woman should be.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay," Thank you, Steve."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay, We ended up making a lunch date.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, I thought you were spending time with Maeby.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay," Yeah. I have to reschedule her. But Mom isn't the only one ""finding love"" where she least expects it-her words."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," Whoa-whoa. ""Finding love-"" she said that? Where, here?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay," Yeah, she won't shut up about him. She said ""tingling"" like, 75 times."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lucille," ...gets me tingling. You know, with Oscar, there's love, and with this tingling, and with Oscar..."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, She said those words in this house?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay, Yeah.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Dad? Hello?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, Michael had just discovered that his father had escaped from the attic.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lucille, Hello?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, This is going to sound like a strange question. Have you seen Dad?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lucille," Of course not. And I'm not talking to you. You tried to scare away Oscar, which didn't work. He's back."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George," I just, uh, I just want to have sex with you. That's, that's all I'm good for."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lucille, Did you hear that? He said he just wants to...
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," Good-bye, Mom."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lucille, ...have sex with me. [To George] You smell like a pine cone.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George," Yeah, that's the weed. I went to my, uh, bleep-hole trailer and, uh, I smoked some, like a cigarette."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lucille, Should we take it into the bedroom?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George, Only if you really love me.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lucille, Of course I do. Oh... What's wrong with you? Where are you going?!
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George, I'm on mushrooms! I'm on bad... mushrooms!
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, And soon the prosecutor's evidence became public.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,John Beard,0
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," It seems that due to the new information sharing provisions in the Patriot Act, the photos had made the rounds through several branches of government, and ultimately, to the US Army itself."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Buster, I just came back to tell you I can't do that wall.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Sergeant Baker, There's no time for that. We're shipping out without you.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Buster, What?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Sergeant Baker, Didn't you see?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Buster, Weapons of... mass destruction?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,G.O.B., Those bastards.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Sergeant Baker, I did not say that.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,G.O.B.," Are you going to let that slide? Are you going to allow your children and your children's children and any children that I might have out there to live in fear for the rest of their lives?! Climb that wall, homo!"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Sergeant Baker, Climb it.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," And just as the men thought the day could get no more surprising, it did."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,G.O.B.," Now, when you do this without getting punched, you'll have more fun."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby," Oh, hey, George Michael."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael, Oh. Hi.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby," They found WMDs in Iraq, so we got a half day."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael," Cool. So, I got a ""C"" on my math test. Not anticipating a good reaction on that."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby," Well, the ""B"" got you glasses. Maybe this time you'll get a neck brace. Anyways, have you seen my Mom?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael, It's possible.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby, She's on her way to meet Steve Holt.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael, Steve Holt? I thought you liked him.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby, I do. I'm crazy about him. But he's obsessed with her. That's all he wants to talk about.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, Lindsay felt bad. Perhaps she had hurt her daughter by putting herself first. But she would have felt worse if she'd remained even a moment longer.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby," But it's only because he thinks she's got a penis. Oh, I told him she was a tranny."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," Meanwhile, Michael was still up in the attic."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Dad? What's going on? Somebody could see you.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George," What's the difference, Michael? You're turning me in, aren't you?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," They say you're involved in something big, Dad. They've got photos."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George," It's not true, but go, knock yourself out, turn me in. I went and saw for myself. She's in love with him."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Then why'd you come back? Why didn't you leave forever like you said?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George," And go where? Make a deal for yourself, Mike. I have no love in my life anymore."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," And Michael realized for the first time that his father was capable of having his heart broken. Later that day, Michael had his meeting with the prosecutor."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis," So, where the hell is he? Come on, Bluth, what's it going to be- your father or your freedom?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, And Michael had to do the right thing.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, I don't know what happened to him.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis," Michael, when we started talking to you, we didn't have anything. But now... we got something. And you're going to do time for it."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Barry, Those are the pictures?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis, They're all over the news.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Barry, Those are balls.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Wayne Jarvis, What?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, Barry was right. Tobias had inadvertently photographed himself while learning to use his camera phone.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Barry," This close, they always look like landscape. Nope, you're looking at balls."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," Soon, forensic scientists confirmed this. And for the second time in two days, the information sharing network put into place by the Patriot Act was put to use."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Chairman, They're balls?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Pilot #1, We're looking at balls. Let's turn it around.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Pilot #2, Copy on the balls.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," And eventually, the news traveled back to the source."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,John Beard," We got one wrong, and we do apologize."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Tobias, I'm on TV.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, And Michael returned home a free man.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Got the glasses. Now you'll do better on those math exams.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael," I think I blew the eye exam too, because every time I take these off, I feel better."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, Let me see them.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael," Hey, I, I've seen this before."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," For a while, George Michael had shared a room with his Uncle Tobias."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George Michael," Uh, there's a ladder."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Tobias," Oh, I don't need it."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," Yeah, I don't think you need glasses, son."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George," Uh, if the cops are waiting, I'm ready to go. I got nothing since your mother deserted me."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," You know, you, you deserted her, Dad. You know, you escaped, and then you faked your death. I'm not so sure she sees you as that reliable. But listen, for what it's worth... I did not turn you in."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George, You didn't?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, No.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," And, I don't know whether it's just Tracy's maternity clothes, but it's very nice to see a softer side of you. Although I'm sorry that you feel you have no love in your life."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George, I-I don't feel that way anymore. Thanks. It's been a long time since someone stood up for me.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael," You found her perfume, huh?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George, There was just a little left in the bottle.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, That was the end of it.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George, Oh.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Michael, It's nice on you.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George, Thank you.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, Oscar returns to find a now distant Lucille..."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Oscar," I'm back. But just for now, 'cause you get on my case, I am out of here."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lucille, Then go. Who needs you?
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, ...which was what attracted him to her in the first place.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Oscar," God, I missed you."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator, Lindsay reconciles with her daughter.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby," Hey, Mom."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay, Hey.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby, I got you something.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay, That is so sweet. You know what? I was hoping we could go to dinner tonight.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby," Oh, I thought you were going to go see Steve Holt at school."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay," No, I just wanted to check him out and make sure he's good enough for my daughter. Is it...?"
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Maeby," It's a ""Sheh-ma-lee."""
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Lindsay, It's gorgeous. I'm wearing it to dinner.
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Narrator," Tobias, traumatized by the public exposure, returns to an unfortunate quirk."
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,Tobias, Thank God-my cutoffs!
2,Sad Sack,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sad_Sack,George, There were cutoffs up here?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator," Michael was using the Bluth Company crane to retrieve the family-owned banana stand after it had been dumped in the bay, a holiday tradition among the local youth. Soon, he returned home so that he and his son..."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, George Michael?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator, ...could share their holiday tradition of rebuilding it.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, Another one of Dad's suits?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B.," Hey, I'm the President now. Filling Dad's shoes. Literally. Except his shoes don't fit. But, I did finally get into Dad's pants. Although I had to have the crotch taken out a little bit."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," You know, G.O.B., maybe it's the suits, but I-I think you may be beginning to alienate some of the employees down at work."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B., What? Oh! That's great... The-The President has to worry about alienating the employees now.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator," In fact, G.O.B. had started to alienate some of his colleagues."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B.," W-Worse that can happen is can I spill some on my $3,000 suit. Come on! Oh, yeah, yeah. The guy in the... the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! Oh. Why don't I just take a whiz through this $5,000 suit?!"
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B., Come on! They like me just fine. You'll see that tonight when they toast me at the Christmas party. Just like they used to with Dad.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," They used to roast Dad 'cause they thought that he had a sense of humor about himself, but he didn't, and neither do you."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B.," Hey, nobody laughed louder than me at any joke about Dad. You're the one who was all Mister I take myself too seriously all the time."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator, Michael did tend to take the Christmas parties somewhat seriously.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Uh, oh, no, no, thank you. Merry Christmas. You can go ahead and put that right in the charity barrel. Thank you very much. Thanks a lot. (To George Michael.) Sorry, pal. We just can't have them resent us."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Tom," I know some of the numbers haven't all added up, and there is some speculation that George has been into the kitty."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B., Into the kitty! He is awesome. Meow. Meow! Meow!
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George," Fire Tom, and get your jackass brother out of here."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," This year, I'm not officially President, and it'll be nice to actually have some fun with my son at a Christmas party."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Maeby, Thank God I don't have to go.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lindsay," Oh, I'm so glad to hear you say that. I want to meet someone there."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Maeby," What? So, I'm not invited to the Bluth Company Christmas party?"
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lindsay," Oh, honey, of course you can go if you want to."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Maeby," Thanks, Mom."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lindsay," No, you're not going to that. You see, if I show up with you, it'll just make me seem like I'm a mother."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Maeby, I've never thought of you that way.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lindsay, That's sweet.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Tobias,"01 in case the Blue Man Group needs their understudy, so..."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lindsay," No, no you have to go, so when men find out we're in an open relationship, they'll see you're no threat. People hear the name Tobias, they think- big black guy."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Tobias," Well, obviously, I'm not a big guy. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par example."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lindsay, I forgot about Carl. Is he still single?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Hey, George Michael, I need you to help me fix up the banana stand."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George Michael, I know. I can't. I'm supposed to go to Ann's parents' Christmas party. We're making yams.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, Tonight? Tonight is the office party.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George Michael," Well, did you want me to go to that? You're always telling me not to have fun at those things."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, Yes. We might even snatch a gift from the charity barrel.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George Michael," Oh... kay. Well, um... Well, I think Ann's parents are having their party on Bethlehem time, which is pretty early, so maybe I can make an appearance."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Make an appearance. Uh, uh, no, no. It's-It's okay, uh, you be with Yam. It's fine. It's good."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George Michael, It's Ann.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, It's good. Have fun.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George, Boy's pulling away from you. Are we having yams? 
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Yeah, I don't know what's going on with him. You know, he's-he's on Bethlehem time. He's spending every moment of the day with this girl. It's, like, I'm his father. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. He should be spending most..."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George," Don't get involved. Believe me, when I thought your first wife was driving us apart, I did not make a stink."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," You complained all the time, and she was my only wife. And she died."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George," Yeah, well. See, things have a way of working themselves out."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Nonetheless. It's family first at the holidays. Oh, God, it's Mom again."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George, Put it on speaker phone. I want to hear her beautiful voice.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille, Aah! Michael! There's a hole in the window. There's been a break-in! Get over here!
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, I'm leaving now.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George, She sounds tense. That means she's not getting any from my brother Oscar. Lovely. That's nice.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille," I heard about the banana stand, and now there's been a break-in. But I have a surprise for whoever it is if he comes back. First I blow him, then I poke him."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Guy has no idea what he's in for. You know, Mom, all the glass seems to be on the outside. Plus, here's your little statue, so, I guess what this says to me is, I doubt anyone was trying to break in, Mom. If anything, someone was trying to break out. Where is Oscar?"
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille," Oh, he's on his walkabout, or pilgrimage."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator," Every year, Oscar attempts the 420-mile walk from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California. In the 12 years he's attempted this, he's never made it past U.C. Irvine."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille, He calls it a quest to recharge his chi. I call it an excuse for him to score his pot and wag his pickle at coeds.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," You sound mad, Mom. Mad enough to throw one of these little lady heads at him."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille, What's that supposed to mean?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Well, it just... You know... Maybe you're a little bit lonely, and you're acting out for attention."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille," Oh, that's ridiculous. I want you to move in with me."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," What?! No. No. No. No, no, no, no. Didn't you adopt a child for this very reason, so that you would never be alone?"
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille," Michael, a mother doesn't have a child to give herself company. Annyong was to teach Buster a lesson."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, And where is that little lesson?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille, I sent him to the Milford Academy to teach him a lesson. I can't remember about what. And Buster left this morning to finish his Army training.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator," In fact, Lucille had refused to drive him to the Army base, so Buster was taking his very first bus ride."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Bus Driver, I can't change a hundred.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Buster," Oh. Oh, damn it. Stop it. Oh."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator, And that's when Buster saw something interesting.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Buster, Oh. That could be good for Army.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator," While just twenty yards away, Michael went to work repairing the banana stand."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, What are you doing here?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Maeby," My mom signed me out of school early, so then she wouldn't have to pick me up later, so then she wouldn't be late for the Christmas party."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, That's about the worst thing I've ever heard.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Maeby, I had to drive because she had a little bit of a buzz on.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," No, that's it."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Maeby, You're doing this alone?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Yeah. Oh, thanks. I guess George Michael's getting a little too old to hang out with his Dad."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Maeby," Yeah, and I'm getting too old for my mom to be with me."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, You know what? Maybe we should go to this party together?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Maeby, Really?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, Yeah. You're my little niece. I think we should be a little bit more time together.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Maeby," Yeah, and if it makes my mom jealous..."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, And George Michael can run back to his precious Ann. Great. Good deal.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator, Michael and Maeby stopped by the office to see if G.O.B. needed help for the party that was now hours away.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B., ...king 63 hundred dollar suit. Come on!
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, Hi there.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B., What's she doing here?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Maeby," Merry Christmas to you, too, Uncle G.O.B."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, Everything all right?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B., I just don't want people's kids getting their sticky little fingers all over these twenty-six hundred dollar pants.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Oh, yeah? You think they're gonna go right for the pants, do you?"
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B.," Okay, okay, okay. So, should-should... should, uh, should... Should-should... should... sh-sh-should Sh-sh-sh... Should-Should... should, uh, should..."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, We'll do it your way. I'm just here to have fun.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B.," Not too much, all right? I already gave my big sexual harassment speech today."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B.," Please refrain from discussing or engaging in any sort of interoffice [bleep]ing or [bleep]ing or finger [bleep] or [bleep]sting or [bleep]ing or even [bleep]. Even though so many people in this office are begging for it. And if anybody does anything with my sister Lindsay, I'll take off my pants, I'll shave [bleep]. And I'll personally [bleep]..."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B., Let's get this going.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," What are you talking about, now? You're not gonna let these people go home and change their clothes?"
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B.," I don't think we need people trying to compete with what I'm wearing. Everybody, uh, come out of your offices, please. Party is now started. Here we go. Let's go. Everybody dance now! Everybody dance now!"
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Oh, I think we're off to a great start."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator," And so, Michael started to become relaxed. And a short time later, his mother arrived anything but."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille, Someone broke in again! The liquor is gone. All of it. Gone!
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator," In fact, G.O.B. had stolen it earlier that day to cut down on the cost of the party."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Al," Hey, need a hand with that?"
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B.," No, Al. I want to spill booze all over my fu..."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille," I'm all alone there, Michael."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," You know, Buster's only stationed about five miles away."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator," In fact, Buster never went to the Army. He'd gotten hooked playing the skill crane and missed his first day. Somewhat ashamed and with nowhere to go..."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B.," Hey, Buster."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Buster," Hey, brother."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator, ...he returned home.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille, Buster! Thank God you're back. There's no shame in being a coward.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Buster, A coward? I'm not a coward. Would a coward have this?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille, What the hell is that?

2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille, You have no idea what it's like to be abandoned by your son.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, Do you see my son? He chose his girlfriend over me.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille, How the worm has turned.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Oh, Mother."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille, Look who feels the sting of an ungrateful child.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Mother, you have to receive something to be ungrateful. The point is, I'm not getting worked up over it tonight. I'm not gonna let anything bother me."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille," Good. I'll get a drink, and then go home, and wait for you to come stay with me."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille, Thank God they've got my brands here.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator, This was an unacceptable solution.

2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lindsay, Hey. Are you guys sticking stuff on G.O.B.'s suit?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Maeby, Shh. Go away. You're going to ruin it.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George Michael, Aunt Lindsay. How's the party?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lindsay," It is the worst Christmas party I've ever been to in my life. Now, watch this. Yep, like my last ten years. And my daughter won't give me the time of day. How was your party?"

2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, I didn't know the lyrics. Where's everybody going?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Ted, We don't work here anymore.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, What?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Ted, Is your sister still around?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator, The Christmas party had been a disaster.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B.," I did the right thing, Michael. If I don't fire them, how do I teach a lesson to the others?"
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, There are no others. You fired everyone.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B.," Oh, that's... that's-that's great. The guy who's dirty dancing with his niece is going to tell the guy in the thirty-six hundred dollar suit how to run the business. Come on."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," I know. Maybe we're better off with me being business-like and you being the good-time, useless party guy."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B., It got us this far.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, Mm-hmm.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B.," And must say that I miss the laughter. Oh, God, how they used to laugh with me."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, At you. We got to figure out a way to hire everybody back. A meeting.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B., A party.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," No, we just had a party."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B.," Yeah, but I didn't get to have any fun."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator," And so, Michael went to work on another Christmas party, this time with the help of his niece."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, I really appreciate you doing this. I didn't want to ask George Michael. Did you see that he showed up at the party for five minutes last night and left without even saying good-bye.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Maeby," Hey, my mom doesn't even want to be in the same room with me."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille," Michael. I was almost attacked last night, in my own home. I walk in and there's a colored man in my kitchen."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," ""Colored""? What color was he exactly?"
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille, Blue.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Tobias," Hello, Lucille."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Yeah, I sent him to your house to keep you safe."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille," Well, he did a terrible job, didn't he? I need someone else. Someone better. What about this one? She's got thick arms."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Mom, you just need to calm down a little bit. You're so tense."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille, How am I supposed to calm down?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George," She sounds tense. That means she's not getting any from my brother, Oscar."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille," I mean, maybe I should move in with you."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator, And Michael realized he needed to retrieve his Uncle Oscar.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, How would you like to go on a road trip?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Maeby," No, I want to stay with her. Let's go."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator, And so the two of them prepared to drive up the coast.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Okay, you're in charge of the radio, and we're not stopping until we find Uncle Oscar."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Maeby, There he is.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," My mom is very stressed out, and, uh, she needs something that I can't give her. Um... maybe a little ""Afternoon Delight""?"
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator," Oscar thought that Michael was referring to a particular brand of cannabis named ""Afternoon Deelite,"" a strain famous for slowing behavior."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Oscar," Well, sure. The question is, which way do I try to get it in her?"
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, I don't need any details.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Oscar, Maybe I'll put it in her brownie.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, Hey!
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lindsay, What happened to you?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Tobias," What? Oh, oh, my ears. The doctor said I can't go to sleep for five hours, or I might die, or something. Oh, I got blown! So I can't sleep!"
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lindsay," Hey, have you seen Maeby?"
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George Michael," You're not going to believe this. Apparently, my dad and Maeby took a drive up the coast."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lindsay, You're kidding me.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Tobias, Uh-oh. I should not have picked at that. That's blood.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lindsay, This is ridiculous. So she's got a new parent.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George Michael," Yeah, now my dad's got a new kid."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Tobias," I'm going to lie down for a little bit. But just, I-I... it's... I can't fall..."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lindsay," Hey, how would you like to come to the party with me today?"
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator," And Oscar was giving Lucille a little ""Afternoon Deelite."""
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille," Mmm, these are really delicious."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Oscar, I'll get some more. Where did she go?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator," And soon, the second Bluth Company Christmas party in as many days began."

2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, You got it. Here you go. Merry Christmas. Where the hell is my brother?

2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator," Later, G.O.B. was inside the banana stand and it was getting pretty hot in there, so he decided to lose a layer."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Hey, look, there's your mom and George Michael. I guess they did come to support us after all."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lindsay, Look at that. They're all over each other. With their little secrets.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George Michael," Well, what can you do, right?"
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lindsay, Yeah. How would you feel about singing a little karaoke?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator," Unfortunately, Lindsay wasn't there to see all of Michael and Maeby's song, and was about to have a similar revelation."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lindsay," But you got some bait a-waitin', and I think I might, Try nibbling a little afternoon delight... "
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Tobias, That's my wife and nephew! We have an open relationship!
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator," Just then, Lucille arrived, craving a frozen banana. And the effects of Lindsay and George Michael's ""Afternoon Delight"" was overshadowed by the effects of Oscar and Lucille's ""Afternoon Deelite."""

2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator, Tobias couldn't hear...

2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Lucille, What the hell was that?
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Narrator," And G.O.B. couldn't move freely. Lucille tried to come to a stop, but the car hit G.O.B.'s banana peel."
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,G.O.B., I can't get out of here. I'm stuck.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael," Mom, are you crazy? You could've killed somebody."

2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, Gonna grab some afternoon...  Does not seem like it would be that dirty.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George Michael, It is catchy.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,Michael, No.
2,Afternoon Delight,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Afternoon_Delight,George Michael, Right. That's the thing.

2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., Don't you find the timing of this meeting a little suspicious? Right before we play his company in softball?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," No, no. Our business is in trouble, and I think he sees an opportunity, so, I figured the guy's a family man. Why not invite him over, and let him see us in our element?"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Maeby," Well, I hope you don't mean the whole family, 'cause George Michael's off with Ann."

2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B.," Hey, screw Sitwell. Comes in here telling us how to build our houses, how to raise our kids. Now, we know what we're doing. We don't need any help from him. Damn it. This thing got pushed in again. Gonna need a butter knife."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, This is what I'm talking about. George Michael's got these powerful little fingers. He should be here.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Maeby," Hey, how do you think I feel? He was the one who said he would help me on this essay for The Old Man and The Sea."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, I'll help you with that later.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Maeby," you have to say it in my own words, okay? Smart, but not too smart. Let's have a four syllable max."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," Do you want to say something, or should I, Tobias?"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Tobias," No. I believe in letting children learn from their mistakes, Michael. They make a mistake once, they shan't make it twice. Whoa! Don't worry. It has not fallen into the garage. Knock on wood."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, You gonna want to help me with that?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Tobias," No, I can't. I have an audition tomorrow. I'm up for a minor but meaty role in a feature film. Confidence Man Two."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B.," Oh, yeah? I didn't see the first Confidence Man."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Tobias, No. Confidence Man Two is my character. I think I'll drive up today and plot my route to the studio.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Maeby," How about I come with you? I mean, I could help you prepare."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Tobias," Yes, well, it's for a con man, which I don't think you know anything about. And besides, don't you have school?"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Maeby," No. Um... today is ""Help Your Dad Follow His Dream Day."""
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Tobias, Great. We can take the carpool lane.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., I need ice.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lindsay, I'm glad Sitwell's coming over. Let him see that we're doing fine as a family. The only help we need is from each other.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," And apparently, whatever's in that bottle."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lindsay," Oh, thanks for reminding me. My Teamocil."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, What a minute. Teamocil? Isn't that that supplement that you and Tobias were hawking before the FDA shut you down?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator," In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk band to promote a supplement that promised better unity and teamwork."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Tobias, (Singing) Teamocil.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Young Maeby, Teamocil may decrease your sex drive.

2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," Oh, God. Mother, not a good time. I'm having a meeting here."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lucille, Look at what Buster sent from the Army.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, It's blacked out.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Oscar," Oh, the government. Keep... Yeah, keep reading."

2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," Well, you certainly tried. You guys wore matching outfits till he was 12."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator, Even once in a magazine cover that had been mocked within the family for years.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Oscar," Lucille, I'll-I'll say it again. You never know what's going to happen in the Army. Remember, Lucille?"

2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lucille, And a piece of toast.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, Please. Stan Sitwell's coming over.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lucille," That hairless freak is coming here? None of his hair is real, you know."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., You mean the guy we're meeting with can't even grow his own hair? Come on!
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," It's called alopecia, and I'd appreciate it if we could all be sensitive to it, okay? He happens to be a very modest and generous man."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lucille, Modest and generous? Then why is he always waving giant $10 million checks over his head every time some...?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," Go ahead, Mom, finish the thought. Every time some children's hospital needs funding?"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lucille," Nonetheless. We could get a giant checkbook, too. We're just not that starved for attention."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator," And later, Sitwell laid out his plan."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, Sorry that my son couldn't be here.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Stan Sitwell," Let me guess. Girlfriend. You know, it could be worse. He could want to marry your mother. (Laughs) Oh, I'm sorry. Is your family not laughing at that yet? Okay, let me tell you what I'm offering. You got a wonderful piece of property here that's going nowhere. So, what I propose is a co-venture with your Sudden Valley Development. The first thing you might want to change, though, is the name. You know, Sudden Valley conjures up the image of a sinkhole, no?"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, I told that to Dad. I told that to my Dad.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Stan Sitwell," I'm thinking, ""Paradise Gardens."""

2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator," When George, Sr. was in charge, he had a habit of shooting down any idea Michael came up with."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," ...and Sudden Valley just sort of implies that something awful could happen all of a sudden. You know? Plus, it's on a hill."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr."," What, are you taking stupid pills? Come on. Save us some money."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator, This was a management tool he used to keep Michael working for his approval.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr.", That was a hard one to say no to.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Stan Sitwell," The only thing I ask is, out of the 450 homes we build, one be given to a disadvantaged family from the inner city."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B.," That's great. So the other 449 families live in fear? Is that what we're saying? I mean, come on! Where's your decenc...? What the hell just fell off your face? One-One... One of those guy's eyebrows just fell in the bowl of candy beans."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Stan Sitwell, I always carry a spare.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B.," Well, I hope you also carry a spare bowl of candy beans."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," G.O.B., I'm very impressed with the offer. And I'm gonna run it upstairs, see what kind of reaction it gets. So to speak."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator, Michael hoped to impress his father.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, Think it all sounds pretty good.

2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator," But their old dynamic returned when George, Sr. did."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr.", G.O.B. was the only one down there who knew how to handle that hairless freak. Thank God we have G.O.B. on our team.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," You know, Dad, G.O.B. doesn't really do all that much for our team. In fact, I think it's time that I get put back in charge."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr."," Michael, listen to me. Lately, your ideas- they're horrible. And Sitwell's just trying to figure out our batting order for the softball game on Saturday. I'm telling you this."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," G.O.B. said the same thing, Dad, but I-I doubt that this guy's trying to drop $15 million to find out our batting order."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr."," Hey, this game goes way, way back."

2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B.," Sorry, I told him to screw off. But get this. He offered me a job."

2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Stan Sitwell," I'm sorry. I must have put it on too high. But you were right. It was a bad offer, and you were smart enough not to take it. You got gumption, you speak your mind. That means you're good enough to work for me."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., *Bleep* you.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B.," And I accepted. He's waiting for me outside. We're gonna swing by his wigmaker. His ""just woke up hair"" is finally ready."

2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B.," It's ready, Mike. They're only gonna hold it for 24 hours."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator," Tobias and Maeby, meanwhile, had mapped the route to the audition."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Tobias," Well, here we are. And home we go. With plenty of time to get you to English class."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Maeby," Wait. You can't do a U-turn on your dream. I say, we get you on the lot and get the Fünke name out there. Start talking you up around the water coolers."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Tobias," Oh, Maeby, we'll never get on here. I mean, behind these walls are the biggest stars in the world. America's treasures."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Andy Richter, Damn it!
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Maeby," Dad, you're auditioning for the part of a confidence man. Let's try a little confidence."

2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, Yes. This is the way it should be. What do you think of when you hear the word Sudden Valley?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,George Michael," Salad dressing, I think. But for some reason, I don't want to eat it."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, Right. But Paradise Gardens...
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,George Michael," Yeah. Okay, I can... I can see marinating a chicken in that. I'm actually here about the softball game. We need some girls on the team this year, right?"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," Yes, we do. That's a league requirement."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator, One that was difficult to meet given G.O.B.'s behavior in the third inning of last year's game...
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., We could just stay out here and wait for another pop-up.

Plus, I got Aunt Lindsay playing this year. I can't very well pull her off the roster. Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good way to think about her, as a backup."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,George Michael, She's gonna be so excited.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, Good.

2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator," Meanwhile, Maeby looked for an empty office to call George Michael."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Maeby, Where are you? I bought you a day. I can't put this book report off forever.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Jeff," Sorry, is this your office?"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Maeby," No, I'm just sitting behind someone else's desk, pretending these are my kids. Can you get Jude Law in here for a meeting?"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Jeff," Oh, I'm just a reader."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Maeby, A reader?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Jeff, Yeah.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Maeby," I need a report by tomorrow, before gym... Lunch with Jim... Carrey. He's the Grinch guy. You're too young."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., So get this. Sitwell loved my ideas.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," My ideas, and I knew it! That's great. You know, Dad never complimented any of those."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., Here's the thing. I need more.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, There were 34 proposals in there.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., You'd be amazed how fast they come out when you read them all in a row.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B.," ""31. Bamboo floor upgrades- cheaper, stronger."" I can't read this word. ""32. Wireless ‘crapability.' "" That one explains itself. ""33."""
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," G.O.B., that was six months worth of work. You can't just blurt them all out at once."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Stan Sitwell, Mr. Bluth!
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., He's coming. I've got to go.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Stan Sitwell, You blew them away. Bought you something. Maybe we can play catch sometime.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator," G.O.B.'s own father had only once played catch with him, and it ended as badly as any game of catch could end."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,White Power Bill, White Power!
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Stan Sitwell,0
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator, G.O.B. was both angry... and overwhelmed by the approval from this new father figure. It was confusing. Michael was less torn and went to brag to his father.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," So, apparently my ideas aren't so bad and that comes from Sitwell himself."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr.", You let your ideas go to Sitwell?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," No, I gave them to G.O.B. Who, uh... works there now."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr.", You let G.O.B. go to Sitwell? What did I tell you? I told you don't...
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," ...let him go, I know, but my point is that I do all the work, Pop."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr."," Yeah, and he makes all the plays. Don't you understand? He was the best softball player in the league."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator, G.O.B. was especially gifted at sacrificing his body for the play.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B.," Yeah! Suck on that, Sitwell!"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator," Although, at times, even that wasn't enough for George, Sr."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr."," Your Tweety Bird dance just cost us a run, you moron!"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr.", Why do you think Sitwell hired him? You can't do this. You're gonna lose the game and you're going to lose the company and you can't do this.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," Come on, what are you saying? If I win the game, you're comfortable with me running the company?"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr."," Yeah, that's what I'm saying."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," I'll win the game. And I'll show him that his little plan didn't work, all right? We can build houses, we can win games."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr.", Now that's what I want to hear!
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, We can win games.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," Lindsay, did that oven vent hit you? Your foot is bleeding."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lindsay, My foot is bleeding.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator, Teamocil may cause numbness of the extremities.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," You're still going to be able to play on our team this weekend, right?"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lindsay, Why do you think I'm taking Teamocil?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, To curb your sex drive.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lindsay, That's right. What team are you talking about?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator, It may also cause short-term memory loss.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," Okay, looks like I'm gonna need that female backup player after all. Ann's really good at softball, huh?"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,George Michael," Yeah, she's amazing. You know, she's got this low center of gravity. You can't knock her over."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," Well, I could knock her over."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,George Michael," Dad, I'm telling you, you can't. They call her ""The Wall."" You know?"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," Oh, that's great. But I could knock her over. I won't, but I could!"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator, And Lucille called on an old lover.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lucille, William?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,General Anderson," Yes, ma'am?"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lucille, You don't remember me?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator," General Anderson had done three tours of duty in Vietnam, but the only memory he'd blocked was being left by Lucille."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,General Anderson," Oh, my God, that touch. Oh, how could I forget? Pat."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lucille, Lucille.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,General Anderson, I could never forget that touch.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lucille," Bill, they're shipping my son Buster off. I can't have that happen."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,General Anderson," I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lucille, Is there anything... I can do?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,General Anderson," Maybe, if you go downtown."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lucille, I haven't done that in 30 years...
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lucille, (Singing) When you're alone and life is making you lonely / You can always go / Downtown / When you've got...
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Drill Sergeant, You make me want to puke!
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator, And so Buster was pulled out of combat training... and put in to USO training.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Buster, Oh... huh...
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., It jolts.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator," And, back at G.O.B.'s new office..."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B.," It's not really doing it right now, but..."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., Michael.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, Do you still need those ideas?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., Are you kidding me? I can't let Sitwell down. I'm desperate here.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, Then I'll make you a deal. I want you to throw the softball game.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., Never! He gave me this.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, Of course he did. Why do you think he hired you?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., He liked my ideas.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," They were my ideas. And no, he didn't. He just wants you for the softball game, because he's trying to make our family look foolish."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B.," I knew you had bad ideas. All right, we'll play him. I'll throw that softball game. Nobody makes a fool of our family without my help."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator," Tobias had talked up the name Fünke, and it was time to audition."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Mort Meyers, What's your name?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Tobias, Tobias.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Mort Meyers, He's too short. Give it to the guard.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Tobias," Oh, I... I'm not... I... On camera, I seem much taller."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator," And Maeby picked up the reader's report, which had now become her book report."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Mort Meyers, What you got there?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Maeby, I can't really discuss it.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Mort Meyers," Well, if you want to get it made, I'm the guy who has to see it. You're the Fünke everyone's talking about? What are you, like, 15?"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Maeby, Marry me.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Mort Meyers," Everyone thinks I look young too. So, who you thinking about?"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Maeby, Jude Law. Why do you ask?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Mort Meyers," Yeah, go young. Young Guy and the Sea. Big Spring Breaker for us. CGI the fish. Let's fast-track this one."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator, And that's when Maeby realized she had become a successful film executive.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Jeff, Here you go. It's all waxed up.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Mort Meyers, All waxed up?! What do you mean?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Maeby, I need something. A job for my dad.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Mort Meyers," Yeah, yeah, sure, okay. Listen to me. Brand-new cars don't get waxed!"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator," That afternoon, it was game time, and Michael felt confident about a Bluth win."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr.", Play ball!
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator," Ann wasn't as amazing as George Michael led his father to believe. But G.O.B. was playing worse than ever, as per his agreement with Michael."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," This guy can't hit, Sitwell. He's never going to touch it!"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Stan Sitwell," Time out! Time out! G.O.B., you okay?"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B.," Yeah, I just can't hit today. Guess you're really disappointed in me."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Stan Sitwell," Hey, everybody has days like this. It's only a game. After that list of ideas you gave me, I don't care if you blow the whole season. Come here, you. Okay, we're good."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator, And G.O.B. finally felt that someone believed in him... even though they weren't his ideas. And he decided to make Sitwell proud.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., I killed that ball!
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Stan Sitwell, Yeah!Yeah! You go!
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," You better pull an ankle or something. Come on, George Michael! Get that ball in there!"
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator, But then he went headfirst into The Wall.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., I'm safe.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr.", You're out!
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., Out?! I was safe! I'm safe! Safe!
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr."," Stop with the Tweety Bird dance, you moron."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., Dad?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, He made the call! You're out! What are you doing?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr."," Shush, shush, shush, shush."

2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Stan Sitwell, He's safe!
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, What the hell are you doing here?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr."," I'm taking care of what you screwed up. You blew it again, Michael."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, Let me tell you something. I blew it when I let you start controlling me again. I even stooped to cheat here at a softball game.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., What? You two have been talking to each other? How come nobody called me?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Stan Sitwell, What's going on there?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, I'm just fixing something that's been bugging me. He was safe. He was. We lost. Get over it.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B.," Yeah, and Stan Sitwell liked my ideas! He really believed in me."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, My ideas.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., Well...
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," And I'm president whether you like it or not, Dad. I don't need your approval anymore."

2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, Really?
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,"George, Sr.", Yeah. See ya.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Lindsay," Michael, I could've sworn I just saw Dad. Or not. I think hallucination is one of those side effects of Teamocil."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Narrator, It isn't.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B.," Thanks for making the right call there, buddy."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, Yeah.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., Sorry I didn't blow the game.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael," No, you did the right thing, and you finally got Dad to one of your ball games."
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,G.O.B., (Whistles through tooth) Screw him.
2,Switch Hitter,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Switch_Hitter,Michael, Yeah.

2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,George Michael," Um, no. Actually, I'm-I'm riding with the Veals. Ann's parents."

2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,George Michael," Right. Here's-Here's the thing, though. It's kind of cramped in there. Plus, a lot of kids are still talking about when you took down that Homecoming banner."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," Now, listen, are you embarrassed to be seen in that car?"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,George Michael," It's not a car, but... but, no."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, I have got to get a new car.

2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Of course you do.

2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Maybe it's time you got out there and started meeting people. You know? Meeting women. Meeting women who didn't give birth to you.

2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Are you serious? Dad gave you the Camaro? I thought you won that on Card Sharks.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,G.O.B.," Michael, I was never on Card Sharks. Dad told us not to tell you."

2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," Yeah, listen, did you buy a company car for everyone in the family except me?"

2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,"George, Sr."," I never gave you a company car. No. I gave you something far more important. I gave you company, which apparently, you don't want to give to me, Michael."

2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, But I got to get an early start because I'm expecting head winds on the stair car.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,"George, Sr.", I have no one to talk to. You see anybody here. You could bring me a book.

2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Barry, Maybe I stood at the plexi glass and a puck hit me. It could happen.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," No, the stock. Now, that means we can sell, right? We can do whatever we want with it?"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Barry, I'll tell you one thing you don't want to do is buy stock in the L.A. Kings.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Do you think I could sell enough to buy a car?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Barry," I thought you had four. Oh, you mean a real one. Yeah, sure. You can get one, as long as everyone doesn't sell the company stock at once. You don't want someone else to get control of the company."

2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, I like these sunglasses. They come with any car?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Car Salesman, Just this one. They throw these extras at you because it's so impractical. No back seat. It attracts so many tickets... the insurance alone costs as much as the last three cars we saw.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, The windbreaker? Windbreaker comes with it too?

2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille, He's with her again. Buster's taken up with that Lucille 2.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, That's why you called me here? I've got my secretary bringing over a bunch of important papers because I thought this was urgent.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille," Well, it's all your fault. You're the one who insisted he get away from Mother."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," Well, I wasn't trying to send him to a new one. Where is he?"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille, He's on the balcony.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Buster?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Buster, Mom is becoming a little controlling.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, What tipped you off? When she locked you out on the balcony again?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Buster, That was half my fault. I thought I saw a graham cracker out there.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, You baited the balcony?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille, (winks) Prove it.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, So I don't typically take sides with Mother... but I-I-I do agree that Lucille 2... might not be the best choice for you.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Buster, I wouldn't even have been there if Mom wanted to go bowling. How am I gonna meet someone who has my interests?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Starla," Hi, Michael."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Hey. Great.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Starla, I have those papers for you to sign.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Perfect.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Starla," By the way, I love your mother."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Buster," Oh, yeah, I do too."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Starla, Oh.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, I think I may have found a new girl for Buster.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille, Good. That Lucille isn't really interested in Buster anyway. She's just trying to get even with me.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Get even with you for what?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille, She wanted me to let in her remodeling crew while she was out of town.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Wait a minute. This tub's a little bigger than it used to be.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator, It was. Instead of letting the construction crew into Lucille Austero's penthouse
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille, Come right in.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator, Lucille had put them to work on a project of her own.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, What'd you do?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Oscar," Well, I sat on one of these jets. But I think we can fix it."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille," Don't give me that look. I moved the wall a couple of inches into her penthouse. Don't think she's not over there right now, plotting her revenge."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille 2," God, the new equilibrium really does... It makes the room seem tighter."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille, She's always a step ahead of me. That's what makes her such a worthy opponent.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, How'd you pay for it?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille, I cashed in some stock. You knew it was unfrozen.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," I know. I sent you that letter. It says not to sell, or we're gonna lose control."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille," It does? I stopped at ""unfrozen."""
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," Lindsay, you didn't cash in your stock, did you? Tell me you didn't."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lindsay, I didn't.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator, Yet.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Club Manager, There's a pretty long wait list for membership right now.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," G.O.B., you didn't sell, did you?"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,G.O.B.," What? No. I'm trying to get a job from you, Mikey. Come on."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," Okay. As long as you two didn't sell, I think we should be okay. I was afraid that I..."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Tobias, I just bought the Queen Mary.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,G.O.B., You're kidding. I was just gonna get a yacht.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Tobias," No, no, no. The club. I was dancing with what turned out to be the club's owner... and he was looking to sell. Oh, he really, really did look like a woman. But anyhoo, can you believe that the only reason the club is going under... is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood?"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, This is unbelievable.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lindsay," Tobias, I promised that money to the country club."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Country club?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lindsay, It's in such a good neighborhood.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, I don't believe this. Did you guys not read the letter?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator," None of them had read past the word ""unfrozen."""
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," Well, I hope you're all proud. Your careless selfish spending sprees may have cost us the Bluth Company."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,George Michael," Hey, Dad, is that your new car in the driveway? I can't believe you got a Corvette."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, It's a company car.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator," Michael had bought a car, and it helped put the company in jeopardy."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Barry, I'm sorry about the patch. I'm testifying against the Kings this afternoon. You can't see it. I just winked.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Barry," So, basically, you're about 2,000 shares short of being the majority stockholders. Now, unfortunately, it's a private stock, so you cannot just buy up the shares unless someone is willing to sell."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Are you sure?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Barry," That's what they said on ""Ask Jeeves."""
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," All right, who's the majority shareholder now?"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Barry," A company called ""Standpoor."""
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,G.O.B.," ""Standpoor""?"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," As in the opposite of ""Sitwell,"" which is run by a certain hairless man who could be very upset with you right now."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,G.O.B., What would he have to be upset with me about?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Are you wearing his eyebrows?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,G.O.B., They make me feel dressier.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Hello.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille," Is it true, Michael? Did we lose the company?"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," Kind of. There's something called Standpoor. Yeah, it's Sitwell."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille, It's Lucille Austero.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Lucille 2?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille," ""Standpoor"" because she can't stand up without falling over. I don't know why she'd have any trouble. A piano could stand on those legs."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille, She's trying to get even with me for the remodeling.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Oscar," I think we're going to need a new floating thermometer. And could I have your, uh, your Blue Cross number?"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," What was...? Let's think about this, Mom. Maybe there's a way that we can reason with her."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille, Give her Buster.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, What?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille, We need our company back.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," Mom, that's horrible."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille, I don't suppose you spent money on something you can return.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Let's give her Buster.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," Starla, do you know where my brother is?"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Buster," Yes, he's on cloud nine. That was me, Michael."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, What's going on?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Where's Starla?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Buster," She's saying good-bye to someone named Q. If she can get past his security system, she's going to tell him it's over."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Buster, She's amazing. We completely connected. And it's all because of you. You made this happen. I feel alive!
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator," Indeed, Starla and Buster did hit it off well, Buster being a sweeter, more supportive man than she was used to, and Starla being a woman that wasn't 70."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," I'm just wondering if you didn't upgrade a little too fast. You want something sensible, you end up getting pushed into something flashy."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Buster, (Whispering) What does that mean?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Don't you think you belong in a Lucille?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator," Maeby, meanwhile, gave reading her script another shot, only to discover her work was done. Her scripts had been noted. So, she went to find the person she thought was responsible."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Maeby," George Michael, I read your notes."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,George Michael," What? Uh, you found the... W-Well, look, I don't... That was a long..."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Maeby," They were great. I mean, they said so many things I wanted to say but I didn't know how, you know? Don't tell anyone, okay?"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,George Michael, Never. Guess she didn't see the drawings.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator," Meanwhile, Tobias prepared to assume ownership of the Queen Mary."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Tobias," No, no, no, it's supposed to say ""Tobias's Queen Mary."" No, that is not what it says. I distinct... hello? Well, I suppose I could just paint over ""Mary."""
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Hot Cop #5," Don't bother, man. This is our club now."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator," Tobias didn't want to sell his new club, but Lindsay did, which is why she hired several members of a local stripper agency called ""The Hot Cops"" to pose as the roughnecks."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Tobias," All right, fellas, look, I know you know nothing but a life on the street. But I'd like to offer you something that the Queen Mary gave me. The joy of the stage. So, maybe you could, uh, start jeté-ing, and stop... je-terrorizing me."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Hot Cop #5, Yeah! Absolutely!
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Hot Cop #4," We could do Rent. Oh, this is joyous news!"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator," And Buster, now convinced that Lucille 2 was the right woman for him, broke up with Starla."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, You okay?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Buster," It was for the best anyway. A girl like that deserves to be taken care of, and I'm just a poor soldier."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, You didn't sell your stock?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Buster," What? No. Your letter said not to, and I would never want to hurt the family."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator, And Michael realized his little brother deserved happiness more than anyone.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," You know, uh, I-I want you to forget about what I said. I was wrong; you two belong together. I'll take care of Lucille 2 for you."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Buster, Really?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Yeah.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Buster, Let her down easy. That right knee could go at any time.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Buster, Starla?!
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator," And at the ""Tobias is Queen Mary,"" Tobias couldn't believe how quickly he had gotten through to his ragtag gang of neighborhood toughs."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Tobias, Wow. You really have made some amazing strides in a half an hour. We have to take this to the streets. We have to strut!
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator," Michael knew if he had any chance of getting control of the company again, he would need to charm Lucille 2."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Lucille 2.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille 2, Your hair.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Can I take you for a spin?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator," But the spin in Michael's new car re-triggered her vertigo. That night, Tobias's plan to change the streets with his gang also turned out to be ill-conceived."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Tobias," Hey, fezellas, looks like you guys are up to no good. Well... this gang used to be like that, too... three, four!"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Hot Cop #5, (Singing) Hip of the Crips / There's a new gang in town...
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Hot Cop #5, Oh! I've been shot!
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Tobias, We miscalculated! Retreat!
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Hot Cop #5, (Yelling) That's not going to help.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator," Meanwhile, Michael and Lucille 2 arrived to find the club nearly empty. Although Michael would have fit in perfectly."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," Tell you what, Lucille, I'm going to take you dancing."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille 2," No, Michael, please. You have undone all of Dr. Sandor Plumb's work."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," Oh, I'm sorry. Look, the reason that I showed up tonight was because I don't think that it's right for you to be dating my brother. I mean, he's met someone else, and frankly, the only reason that he asked you out tonight was because I wanted him to get the stock back from you so that I could regain control of the company. But... I would... I'd rather have my brother back, so... Sorry."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille 2, I understand.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Thank you. And I... do not blame you for not liking the Bluths anymore.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille 2, Like the Bluths? I love the Bluths.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Why did you buy up all of our company stock?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille 2, To support you guys. I have always had a standing order to buy up any available Bluth stock.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," You do know that we're about 2,000 shares short of controlling the company now, though?"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille 2," Well, y-you could have some of mine."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Really? Would you do that?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille 2," Yeah, of course."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," Well, that's... Thank you."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille 2," Actually, there is a condition."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Anything.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille 2, Call me a cab.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Ah. Because of my driving. Yes. Let's...
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator," And so, the next day, Michael was thrilled to have control of the company back."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,G.O.B., I fixed everything.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, Oh?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,G.O.B.," With the business. It's all taken care of. You didn't think I could, but I did."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael," G.O.B., what did you do?"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator, G.O.B. had run into Lucille 2 shortly after Michael dropped her off.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,G.O.B.," My mom really took up a bunch of your space, huh? What a bitch."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille 2," What, what do you mean?"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,G.O.B., When she expanded her bathroom and moved your wall over. That's why all your stuff's sticking out.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Lucille 2, (Chuckles awkwardly) Your mother really has a way of getting my goat.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator," So, G.O.B. [bleep]ed Lucille 2."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, You what?
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,G.O.B.," Oh, and she's not going to give the shares back now."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Michael, You just said you fixed everything.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,G.O.B.," Oh, I meant my problems. Yeah, she's going to make me the new president. But you don't need to prove yourself to me, little brother. You will always have a job here. But I do need the keys to the company car."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, Lucille 2 reclaims some space, the Queen Mary changes hands once again..."
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Barry," This is so amazing. I've wanted a small family restaurant since I got the Kings' settlement. It still has the dungeon area, right?"
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,Narrator, ...and G.O.B. gets needy.
2,Queen for a Day,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_for_a_Day,G.O.B., Let's go for it.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, Michael Bluth was working at home when his son made a curious request.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George Michael," Dad, would anyone miss this Peter and the Wolf read-along record?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Actually, I think that's part of the model house decorations. Why?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George Michael, You're right. My girlfriend Ann wants to have a Christian music bonfire here.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, That sounds like some mild fun. I think we've got some Christmas music.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George Michael," Oh no, it's not a ""Christian music"" bonfire. It's a Christian ""music bonfire."" You know, where we burn all satanic music. The thing is though, the only music I have is either instructional or humor."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, He'd been particularly fond of a CD of something called The Jerky Boys.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Hello.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George Michael," Hey, nitz. Hey, jerky. I want to buy a house, Dad. It's gotta be big."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," You-you said, ""Dad,"" buddy."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George Michael," Shut up, jerky."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Maeby," Hey, George Michael, Jesus called, he wants your Thriller album."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Yeah, I don't think the bonfire is such a great idea."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George Michael," I know it might be weird, but you know, Ann's my girlfriend, so I think I'll go buy some albums today. Hey, can you cover for me at the banana stand if I do that?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Maeby, No.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," I'll cover for you, pal. It's been a long time since I've been down at that banana stand."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George Michael," Oh, okay, good. It's the only way we're ever going to get it air-conditioned."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille," Michael, how would you like me to owe you a favor? I want you to bid on me at the charity auction this year."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Okay, now I'd like to use up my favor and decline. Isn't that Buster's annual job?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille," Yes, but I can't have a replay of last year."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, ... when Buster inadvertently bid on Lucille 2.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Buster," $10,000!"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille 2, Buster.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Buster, (Shrieks.)
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, And you're embarrassed to have Oscar bid on you.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille, With his two pair of pants- you bet.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lindsay," Oh, hi, Mom. I have the afternoon free."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille," Really? Did ""nothing"" cancel?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lindsay," All right, I need to borrow a fur."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," I thought you were antifur, Lindsay."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," In fact, weren't you protesting some hunter gun thing yesterday?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lindsay, I stopped by. I hadn't chosen a side.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lindsay, Murderers! You're all murderers! Murderers!
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Frank Wrench, And there are plenty of rules about guns already on the books. You're not allowed to sell a gun to a kid. You're not even allowed to fire your gun in the air...
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lindsay, Is that Frank Wrench?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Frank Wrench, ...on the Fourth of July.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," In fact, it was People's Choice nominated actor Moses Taylor, famous for his portrayal of the rule-abiding detective Frank Wrench, star of the television show Wrench."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Frank Wrench," Well, that's one rule I'm not going to follow."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Frank Wrench, That's the Second Amendment. Read it.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, And what do you need with one of Mom's furs?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lindsay, I'm... cold.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille, So am I. No.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lindsay," All right, look. I met Moses Taylor. We're having a date in the park tomorrow."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille," Try to get him to bid on you at the auction tomorrow, because Michael can't. He's bidding on Mother."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Except that I'm not. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go work at the banana stand."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lindsay," And I'm going to see if I can get a wrench to strip my nuts. I, uh, tried to be sexy. It just... got away from me."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,John Beard,0
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Tobias," Bad news, Michael. I'm afraid the Blue Man Group and I have parted ways. Seems I am officially no longer a standby understudy."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," ""Cease and desist."""
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Tobias, Seems they don't appreciate competition.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, Tobias had recently taken out an ad in a trade magazine for a one-man show.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Tobias," television's Frank Wrench. I need to prove to her that I'm not just a man, but a man's man."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Oh, I think she knows that."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Tobias," Jesus, it's the wolf! That is the wolf! The wolf is upstairs!"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Think it's just my son's Peter and the Wolf record.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Tobias, I thought that was a homefill.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, Michael went to check on his fugitive father who was living in the attic.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George, You heard my call?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Yeah. Have you been doing that all over town? Because people think that there's a wolf on the loose.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George," Yes, there is a wolf on the loose, and his name is Oscar. Tell me he's not going to be bidding on your mother at that charity auction with my money."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Is that why you called me up here, Dad? Because you are a fugitive, and as far as she knows, you're in another country."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George, It's driving me crazy. They're parading in public.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George, My back is... it's-it's in knots. I haven't had a massage since prison.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Hope that was forced.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George," But then I found a way to fix my back in this old catalog. Look at this hot tub. I can... I can use it for so many things. It can be my, you know, water supply. And those, uh, premade boil-in-bag meals? You just toss those in there."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, You're not getting a hot tub.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George," Oh, come on, please?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Dad, please, come on. We can't afford that. We're in this mess because of you. I'm working down at the banana stand just so that we don't lose a shift. We're done pampering ourselves in this family."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Yeah, I would like the biggest air conditioner you've got. No, no, not tomorrow. I need... I need it today. I'm not here tomorrow."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," Just then, Michael ran into a woman whom he hadn't seen in years."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell, Michael?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Sally Sitwell.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, Michael had always been in love with Sally Sitwell.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Young Sally, We could steal a golf cart.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Young Michael," No, they keep 'em locked up. I know 'cause I have a key."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Young Sally, I'll go get my sweater.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Young Michael," Oh, so you want to use the key."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, But his father had a long-time competition with her father.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George," It looks like my boy's going to be sticking it to your daughter, Sitwell. Stick it to her!"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," And as a result, Michael was awkward around her."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Young Sally, Should we go or... stick around?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Young Michael, No! We're not going to be sticking anything. Not-not going to stick a thing.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," Since then, he'd always been eager to show her that he'd become a man."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell, Are you still working here?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," No, no, no, filling in for my son."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," Michael. And wow, Sally... Stickwell."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell," Right, because the guys wanted to stick it to me."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," Well, no, I... I never... Michael used to say that."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," No, I did not."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," Well, you said other stuff."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, I absolutely did not.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," Man, he loved you!"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell," So, G.O.B., tell me, are you still doing your little tricks?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B., Do you consider this to be a little trick?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell, (Gasps.) Did you just squirt me with something?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," It was lighter fluid. I didn't put in a new flint. But still, where did the lighter fluid come from? That's bleep great."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell," Well, Michael, maybe I'll see you over at the club. We never really took that cart ride, did we?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," And we never will. 'Cause I'm not there. Nor am I here. I mean, I'm here today."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell, I'm going to go.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Okay.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell, Okay.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," Smooth, Michael... like her father's head, chest, arms, legs and ass."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, What are you talking about?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," He's hairless, Michael. It's a condition. And I hate the guy, but at least he's got bleep. Satiny and smooth, probably."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Well, I'm just different that you, G.O.B. You know, I'm not going to, you know, siphon gas out of some girl's car like you used to in high school just so you can show up and say, ""Car troubles?"""
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," It's called ""taking advantage."" It's what gets you ahead in life."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Like you did with our biggest shareholder, Lucille Austero?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," That was a one-time thing, Michael. It's over."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, It was far from over.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille 2, Shall I put the Posturepedic in the down position?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B., Let's elevate the knees this time.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille 2, Oh!
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," And you just let Sally Sitwell slip away right when she was ready to go, and you were scared."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, What are you talking about?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," Cock-a, cock-a, co..."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Come on. You gonna get off and do your little dance, too?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," No, I... I hurt my ankle yesterday shooting hoops or something."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," Cock-a, cock-a, cock-a, co...! Oh, God, my ankle!"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Buster," Oh, don't move, don't move."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," No, no, no, it hurts bad!"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Buster, Let me hold it! Mother! Mother!
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," Buster, it hurts."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, Michael decided that perhaps he should go after Sally.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Oscar, Have you seen my other pair of pants?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille," Lupe washed them, and they sprouted. I threw them out."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Oscar," Oh, that puts a lot of pressure on this pair."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lindsay, I think this one's good. Looks like it would've put up a fight.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille, I put up one to get it.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lindsay," Hey, as long as it gets Frank Wrench to bid on me."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille, It won't.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Hey, Mom, I need to borrow your country club card. There's a... friend I have that has lunch there often I'd like to run into."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille, Sounds like you're asking for a favor.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, And I know what that's going to cost me. I'm willing to bid on you.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille," I'll give you the money. Start at five grand. If there are other bidders, back off gracefully. Shout out, ""I get her 364 days a year for free"" or something."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, You're not going to hear that phrase.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," Soon, Tobias came across a flier that promised to improve both his masculine self-image and his financial standing."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Tobias," They're literally blue, not sad."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," Meanwhile, Michael went to have his accidental encounter with Sally, but had forgotten about the club's dress code for lunch."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Excuse me.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Maitre D', We have a dress code for lunch.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, I can't wear this. I look like I'm 16.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell, Michael?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Oh, no."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Stan Sitwell," Hello, Michael."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Stan. Hello, Sally."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell," Hi. So, are you meeting someone here for lunch?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," No, I-I was going to, then they canceled, so I'm going to take off."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell," No, just join us, please?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," Michael knew he couldn't say no, but he also knew he couldn't flirt in front of her father."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Let's do it.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," And at another table, G.O.B. was being taken out to lunch."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille 2, Read me the appetizers again.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," ""Fried cheese... with club sauce."""
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille 2, Oh...
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," ""Popcorn shrimp... with club sauce."""
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille 2, (Moans.)
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," ""Chicken fingers..."""
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille 2," Oh, stop it, you're making me dizzy."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," ""...with spicy club sauce."""
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille 2," No, I mean stop it!"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, G.O.B.?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B., Michael.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Stan Sitwell, Why don't you join us?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," Oh, no, I'm just helping her eat."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Stan Sitwell," Oh, if you'd prefer privacy..."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B., What? No. I didn't even want to have lunch with her in the first place. I just... I would... I just... (Clearing throat.)
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, And so lunch continued with both Bluth boys trying to prove they weren't interested in the women they were interested in.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell," You know, when I saw those golf carts, it kind of brought back some memories."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Did you have too much club sauce on your calamari?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille 2," G.O.B., read me the desserts."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B., She... probably forgot her old-lady glasses.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille 2," What is the matter with you, Goby?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Stan Sitwell," I'm happy to read to the lovely lady. ""An assortment of ice creams and sorbets."""
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, You all right with him reading to your girl?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B., Not my girl. Why don't you read to your girl?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Well, I... Come on, I don't have a girl. (To waiter.) No, thanks, already taken care of. Thank you. Thanks."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Waiter #3," I'm sorry. Apparently, there's been some increased activity on your card. (Whispering.) It's been declined."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," In fact, the increased activity on Michael's card was his father's."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Worker #4, Do you really think a hot tub is the best thing for someone with your condition?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George," I can't see, but, uh, I didn't know there was a doctor installing this."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Steve Holt, Someone order a case of Bag-N-Boil frozen dinners?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Stan Sitwell," I'm happy to get this, Michael."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," No, no, no, please. Stan, I-I'll do it. (To waiter.) Um... can you put this on my mother's card?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Waiter #3," Your mother? No, no, no, no. She is a pool member only. And you'll excuse me if my tone is not polite, but this is more polite than she has ever talked to me."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, Michael had a feeling why his credit card had been rejected.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, What the hell did you do?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George," I overdid it. Oh, it's so hot."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, Michael's father had just installed a hot tub in the attic.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, What happened to you?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George," I tried to drink some of the water, and it was too hot and it tasted like soy sauce. I think the teriyaki chicken burst."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," That's why people typically don't cook in these, or install them in attics."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George," You gotta get it out of here, Mikey. My eyes... they're burning."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Want to thank you for charging it to my credit card. You made me look very foolish in front of Sally Sitwell.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George, Did you stick it to her?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," No, I didn't. You screwed that up, just like you screwed up this hot tub. Is that a Veal Marsala stuck in the intake?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George," They all looked so good on the boxes, You know it... it's good you backed off Sally. I don't need that guy saying his daughter's sticking it to my loser son."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," You know something? The reason that I never went after her is because you were always pushing me, but now that I know that I don't have your approval, I-I think that, uh, I think that I'll finally go for it."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George, This isn't turning into the party hang out I hoped.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Hey.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George Michael," Hey. I thought I heard something before, like a wolf drowning or something."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," I think that that was maybe the house settling. Speaking of settling, how's Ann?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," I mean, have you settled on an artist's work to burn?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George Michael," Well, I was thinking Eminem for awhile."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Sure.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George Michael," But, you know, everyone's gonna be burning Eminem, so, you know. Then I got this Pat Boone album, but the guy's Christian. But, you know, I don't know, somebody's gotta burn, right?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Well, I guess."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George Michael, All right.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Hey.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Tobias," Oh, boy. I got some looks on the bus 'cause of this."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, What are you doing with that thing?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Tobias," I am going to catch that wolf, Michael. I'm gonna shoot it with this tranquilizer gun, get the reward, and bid on my woman at the charity auction."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Isn't there some kind of a waiting period for a rifle like that?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Tobias, It turns out there is. Two weeks? Isn't there a loophole?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Gun Shop Owner," Well, there is a gun show loophole."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Tobias," But what timing, huh? I mean, right out back they were having one. Ah, G.O.B. I'm going hunting for my wife."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," How lame was Lucille 2 at lunch, huh?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," You've got attached, haven't you?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," You're not going to tell anybody about this, are you?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Come on. I'm not one to judge. Every time I've gone out with Sally I've looked like I'm 12 years old. But, yes, I probably will tell people about this."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," Maybe we can strike up a deal. You keep this to yourself, I help you get Sally. Siphon a little something from her car. You show up in the Corvette, looking like a man- ""Car troubles?"""
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Probably shouldn't do the fireball when you siphon the gas.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," Guess this flint's still got a little life left in it, huh?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," Lindsay, meanwhile, was waiting in the park for her date with Moses Taylor."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Frank Wrench, I'm sorry I'm late. Fans. Sometimes it takes a while to jar their memories.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Frank Wrench, Nice fur. You know there's some nuts out there who'd want to throw red paint all over you. Wait a minute. I think there's one right over there.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lindsay," Oh, my God, you're..."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Frank Wrench, Someone needs to read this.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, And that's when Lindsay's heel went out.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Tobias, Ah... I got him!
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Frank Wrench, False alarm.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Frank Wrench," Oh, crap."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lindsay, I'm being saved by Frank Wrench.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Frank Wrench," (No, you're not!)"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lindsay, Frank Wrench.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Frank Wrench, Shut up! Shh!
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," But unbeknownst to Lindsay and Tobias, the actor who played Frank Wrench wasn't saving her, but was just trying to distance himself from the outlandish ""Moses Taylor Hunts People"" scandal that had been started by a rabid antigun fanatic. And that night, Michael went to help Sally with the car problem G.O.B. had created..."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, What the hell?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," ...only to find out things had gotten out of hand for G.O.B. Michael, however, did look heroic as he went to put out the fire. Unfortunately, Sally arrived too late to see him that way."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell," God, what happened?!"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Car... trouble. (Coughing.)
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, G.O.B. had just blown up a car.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B.," Next thing I know, I'm running for my life. And all I could think was if something were to ever happen to me, how sad I'd be, you know?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille 2, What you did to me at lunch today... You were ashamed to be with me.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B., No! I was ashamed to be seen with you. I like being with you.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille 2," I'm sorry, but you have no courage."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B., How can you say that? Shh! Thought I heard my mom. (Sotto voce.) How can you say that?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," And on the other side of the wall, Lucille was finalizing her plans for the evening."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille," You can bid up to $10,000."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, The deal is off. You didn't tell me it was a restricted membership. Just find somebody else to do your bidding.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille, There is no one else to do my bidding.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell, Hi.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Hi. Hey.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell," They said I could see you, finally."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Yes.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell," Oh, God, I just feel... awful for whoever's car that was."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Mm-hmm. I know it. (Coughs.) Sally, I was thinking that maybe you and I could..."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell, Don't try to talk. I have to run anyway. I got to do this charity auction thing.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Intern," I'm sorry, sir, your Blue Cross/Blue Shield was denied. We've called your mother."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, (Coughing.)
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell, I'll be back. I'll check on you later. Feel better.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, (Continues coughing.) ...go out sometime. Mmm.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," Michael decided to bid on her at the auction, and he knew just where he could get the money to do so."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Yeah, start draining the hot tub. It's going back."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," And Lucille, with no other prospects, turned to the son she least expected to support her..."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille," G.O.B., I don't suppose I could pay you to bid on me at a charity auction."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, ... and G.O.B. was just depressed enough to do so.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,G.O.B., Whatever you want.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille," Oh, goody!"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," And finally, George Michael and Ann's Christian music bonfire was underway."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Uncle Paul, Eh? Eh? Without ever going to the gym.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George Michael, I can't believe how many people you told about this.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Maeby, I hope I didn't confuse people by saying it was a CD burning party.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Steve Holt," Great party! (Laughing.) Maeby, I burned, like, ten CDs from somebody's MP3 player."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Ann 2.0, This is a disaster.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Maeby," You know, maybe you should try listening to some of the music."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George Michael," Some of the artists are kind of talented. I don't know if you've ever heard of The Jerky Boys. They do these prank phone calls. It's kind of old school, but... I have the tape in my room. I accidentally didn't burn it yet."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," Meanwhile, the auction began."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Auctioneer," Next up, we've got last year's charity case- Lindsay Fünke."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, Lindsay showed up...
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Oh, no, not again."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, ...although she was still feeling the effects of the tranquilizer.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lindsay, Stick a wrench in me; I'm done.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Tobias, My wife is humiliated. This is my chance to right the small wrong that I did.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, You shot her in the ass with about four ounces of horse tranquilizer.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Tobias," I haven't been the perfect husband- yes, I admit that. But now is my chance to be a hero."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Tobias," Please, Michael, give me some of your money."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," I've got $5,000, and I need that for Sally. But if you want to make a low bid..."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Tobias," $5,000!"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Auctioneer, For that? Sold!
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, I think you overpaid.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," George Michael's prospects were also improving, as the two made prank phone calls together."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Ann 2.0," Hey, rubberneck!"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Ann, could you and George Michael please call someone else for a little while?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Ann 2.0, He knows it was us!
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,George Michael, What?!
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Auctioneer, We finally got a good one coming up- Sally Sitwell. What do I hear?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Voices,$500.00 
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Stan Sitwell, You're not bidding? I was hoping you would.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, You were?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Stan Sitwell," You're a good kid; you always have been. Not like that showboat of a father of yours, if you don't mind me saying."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," I-I-I've called him so much worse. The truth is, sir, I am interested, but I don't have the money to buy your daughter."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Stan Sitwell," (Chuckles softly.) Well, you sure do drive a nice car, and I need one. Mine got torched today. Drop it off when you drop my daughter off tonight."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," And finally, with both the approval of Sally's father and the lack of approval of his own, Michael was ready to make his move."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael,"$15,000.00 "
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell," (Laughing.) Wow. I got to tell you, this puts a lot of pressure on me."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, It's for a good cause.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell," I heard it was to reseed the greens. It's going to be a lot of shifts for you at the banana stand, huh?"
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," I should be honest with you. I don't have that much money, and I sold the Corvette to cover it."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell, That was quick; to who?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael," Your father, as a matter of fact."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell, My father?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, Yeah.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell, My father can't drive a convertible.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Stan Sitwell, Mind if I open it up?
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Stan Sitwell, Wow! She's got some pickup.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell," This is just like him. He always interferes with everyone I date. Well, you can tell him to give you your car back."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, But... I bought you.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Sally Sitwell," Sorry, I'm not like you. I'd almost rather date someone my father doesn't approve of. Thanks anyway."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Michael, That-that-that is like me. That's exactly like me.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator, And soon it was time for G.O.B. to bid on his mother.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Lucille, The only one bidding on Lucille 2 is that hairless Sitwell.
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Auctioneer," Eight, nine?"

2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Auctioneer," Sold! Up from $800 to $10,000. Wow! You guys really want a new golf course. And all from nonmembers."
2,Burning Love,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Burning_Love,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, George Sr. shows up to bid on Lucille..."

2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B., I thought you had vertigo.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lucille," She'll sell the company, or break it up into little parts or something, all under the guise of ""caring"" about our family."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, You've got to stop quoting when you drink.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, I certainly hope she's not planning a move.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lucille, I wouldn't put it past her.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lucille," She'd love to get at me any way she could. That's why she's been flirting with G.O.B. She's trying to prove that she's closer to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know how little I care for G.O.B."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, I think that makes the joke on G.O.B.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",George Michael," Hey, Dad."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Hey, buddy. Was that Gangee who was just... You all right?"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, Sorry. Your grandmother had a little accident here.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",George Michael, Oh. Does that mean she's going to have to come live with us?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," No, no. No. It was her drink, and even if it wasn't..."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Do you remember when I bid on Sally Sitwell at the bachelorette auction? They sent me this basket with all this stuff for our date- you know, the whole package. Anyway, I thought maybe we could do it together, you know, sort of like a Valentine's present."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",George Michael, You're not gonna take Sally?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Sally? No, no, I wanted it for us. I never wanted to be with Sally."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator," Actually, Michael had gone over to Sitwell Enterprises..."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Sitwell Secretary, Michael Bluth to see Sally.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator, ...one day earlier to set up the date with Sally.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Sitwell Secretary," I'm afraid she's not here, Michael. If you'd like me to take the package, I can give it to her."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," No, no. This is, uh, this is not for her. It's for my son. Just... don't tell her I came by."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator," In fact, Sally wasn't there, and the person Michael saw was her father."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Stan Sitwell, You kidding? This makes me look like my daughter.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Stylist," Oh, no one's going to think that."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Stan Sitwell, I look like Edgar Winter here. Forget it. I've gotta get to spin class.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," So, what do you say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",George Michael, What's Kama Sutra oil?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, Maybe it's not for us.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," Valentine's Day, when Cu... Oh! Was your mother here?"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, You all right? I'll help you up.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," Oh, that is quite a basket you've got there, Michael. That Sally Sitwell is one lucky lady."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Well, I'm not so sure that she's actually right for me anyway. But you got one of these, too, didn't you? You, you bought Lindsay at the same auction."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," Well, yes, but I'm afraid I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run, if you will, so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, There are just so many poorly chosen words in that sentence.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator," Tobias wanted to make sure that everything was perfect for Lindsay, so he went to check it out first."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias, Oh... body chocolate. It's a wonderful package. I'll take it.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Activities Director, You just did.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Why don't you take this? I don't have anyone to go with, anyway."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," Oh. Can you imagine how jealous that would make her? ""Where's Tobias?"" ""Oh, he's just sharing a romantic horseback ride with Michael Bluth, and they're dipping each other in..."" Oh, you didn't get any body chocolate?"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, I-I didn't mean with me. I hate to see you struggle like this. In fact... Why don't you let me ask her for you?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," Well, Michael, you really are quite the Cupid, aren't you? I tell you, you can zing your arrow into my buttocks any time."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Okay, you know what you do? You buy yourself a tape recorder, you just record yourself for a whole day. I think you're going to be surprised at some of your phrasing."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias, Butterscotch! Want a lick?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator," And later, Lindsay stopped by the office, at Michael's request."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Great. Thank you. Listen, I want you to take my Romance Package at the Four Seas Hotel."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay," Oh, yay!"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, That's great. Tobias is gonna be thrilled.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay," Oh, I have to go with Tobias?"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Lindsay. Your husband really wants this to work. Come on, let me play Cupid this year."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay, I thought he went already.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Yeah, I'm giving you mine."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay," Oh, because you're too afraid to ask Sally Sitwell to go with you."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, That's not true. That's not true at all.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay," Chaw-chee, chaw-chee, chaw-chee, chaw."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, What is that? Is that a chicken?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B., What's this?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay," Oh, Michael's scared to ask out Sally."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," No, I'm not."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay," Chaw, chee-chaw, chee-chaw."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B.," Oh, this is priceless."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, You look ridiculous...
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B., Coka-coh! Coka-coh! Coka-coka-coka-coh...
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, Come on. These aren't even birds. I am not... That's enough! There are people working here.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B.," Listen, I think that Lucille 2 is up to something."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, Mom said the same thing when she came over. I thought she was just ticked off 'cause you're seeing her.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay, What? You're seeing Lucille 2? Does Buster know?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B., No. And I'm not. Just don't tell... people. I'm playing the part of the gigolo so that she'll keep the company afloat. But you know what? Something weird happened yesterday when I was trying to find a way out of there.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B., Hello?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator," In fact, it was Stan Sitwell calling her, as he'd become quite taken with Lucille 2, himself."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," You know, it all makes sense. I mean, why else would Sally Sitwell be avoiding me?"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay, Because she thinks you're a loser.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B., And why would Lucille 2 be so distant toward me?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay, 'Cause she knows you're a loser?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," I think it's pretty clear. Lucille 2 and Sitwell are working on a business deal. Lindsay, I'd like for you to go over to Sitwell and see what you can find out. I can't go there again."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay, Why do I have to do that?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, Because you've been helping yourself to the company money for quite some time.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," It's not like you do anything for the family, anyway."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay," Well, G.O.B. doesn't do anything for the family."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B.," Hey, I'm bleeping Lucille 2."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay," Oh, I could do something like that."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B.," Yes, this was what Dad was really good at- getting us out of tight spots."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator," In fact, at that very moment, George, Sr. was in a tight spot, as he'd gotten himself wedged under the furnace while chasing after a sourball that had rolled out of his pocket."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me","George, Sr.", (Sighs.) (Howls like a wolf.)
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator," Eventually, Michael rescued him."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, I'm just starting to worry that she's going to sell us out.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me","George, Sr."," I think the answer to this problem is money. Now, this may just be me having my head against a hundred-degree furnace for an hour, but... maybe we should bring in Jack Dorso."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, Uncle Jack?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me","George, Sr."," Well, no. He's not my uncle. He was my dad's friend. But, uh, this guy has got a fortune."

2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator," When the actor who played Red McGibbon was jailed for his Communist sympathies, Jack Dorso made one attempt at a solo Bullet feature. But the audience was not ready to accept Bullet as a romantic lead, despite his powerful upper body. So he started a chain of gymnasiums, having stolen the idea from Red during a prison visit. And as the years passed, he became well known for his annual birthday feats of strength."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Uncle Jack, Five pounds for each year of my life!

2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Uncle Jack, Too much!
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," If he's got so much money, how come we never called him before?"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me","George, Sr."," But I have. I mean, there wouldn't be a Bluth Company without him. I could never have afforded that first tract of land. But he always wants something in return. I don't know- see if you can talk your mother into taking another bullet for the Bluth family."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator," So, the family gathered at Lucille's to welcome and solicit Uncle Jack. And remember, he wasn't really their uncle."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lucille, Buster. Nice of you to take a break from that common whore you've been dating.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Buster," She is not a whore, Mother. She happens to be the new secretary of the Bluth Company. And, yes, she's more experienced than a normal girl, but sometimes love should be terrifying."

2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Buster, I'll be right in! And then maybe we can talk about... (Grunts.) making that love!
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lucille," Well, I shouldn't complain. It's better than you dating Lucille 2, that bitch!"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Buster," Lucille 2's not a ""B,"" Mother. She's kind, and she's caring and she's certainly less experienced than that whore that I'm dating now."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator, And perhaps it was screaming it out loud that made Buster realize that he missed Lucille 2.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, I'm wondering if you can keep some of the more piercing profanities down when the 90-year-old fitness buff gets here?

2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay," He's been flirting with me all night. I was thinking maybe it would be best for the family if I went on that romance thing with Drag, instead of Tobias... which would be a drag."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Yeah, that's just the kind of joke Drag can't hear."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay, So what did he say about the money?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, He said he'd like to sleep on it.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator," Meanwhile, Buster had decided to pursue a new girlfriend. His old girlfriend."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Buster, Hey... brother?! What are you doing here?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B., I'm keeping an eye on the woman who controls our company.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Buster, In her robe and slippies?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B.," I'm getting into her head. I think she's planning on selling our company to Stan Sitwell. But I've lost her trail, and I don't think I have the skills to pick it up."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Buster, Skills?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Buster, These kinds of skills?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B., Not really.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B.," But if you could get me one of those outfits, we could hide in the bushes or something and spy on them."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Buster, I would like to see her again. You've got it!
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator, And Michael told his father the good news about Uncle Jack.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me","George, Sr.", You're pimping out your sister?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, You were pimping out my mother.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me","George, Sr."," Yes, because she was sleeping with my brother. But your sister?!"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, Everything's gonna be fine. No one's going to get hurt. No one is going to get hurt.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Maeby," Oh, hey, Michael. My dad wanted me to thank you for the romantic getaway. Don't tell me what that means."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, Where is your dad?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Maeby," He left dressed all westerny. You can leave me out of that part, too."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator, And Michael realized that perhaps somebody would get hurt.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, I screwed my brother-in-law.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Maeby," Well, I'm all grown up now."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator," So, Michael rushed to the Four Seas Hotel to keep Tobias from finding out about Lindsay's date."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, Hi!
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," Michael! Michael, this is Jeff. He does all the horse work here. You'll meet him again at the end. Plus he gets you your juice. Not your first juice, but the one you get at the spa."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, That's right- you've done this before.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias, But not with a lovely lady. Jeff doubts one's coming at all. Don't you...?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," Sorry, sorry..."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, About the lovely lady...
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Uncle Jack, Stop! You dropped the boot! You dropped the boot!
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator, Michael came up with the only evasion he could think of.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Uncle Jack, He dropped it! Let him get it!
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Tobias, the, uh, the lovely lady, she's going to be a little bit late. She's doing some work. She said to go ahead and get started without her. Saddle me up, Jeff."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Wrangler Jeff, It's going to take a few minutes to tack another horse.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator, So Michael embarked on the romantic adventure he'd spent so lavishly for.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," Well, you certainly didn't help my reputation as a ladies man with Jeff. But we'll clear all that up in the spa when I get my facial."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Hey, did you ever get that tape recorder?"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," You're funny. Come on, boy. Hu-Chah-Chah! Ha-cha! Whoa!"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator," Soon, the next group began their romantic date."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay," So nice of you to cover this, Uncle Jack."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Uncle Jack, My pleasure. It's nice to do something you don't need legs for.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Uncle Jack, (Yells.) (Sputtering.) Towel!
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator," And Lucille 2 showed up with Stan Sitwell, who did look a little like Edgar Winter. And one by one, they each enjoyed the activities of their romantic getaways."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias, Body chocolate?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, No.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator," Of course, in the spa, the jets proved too powerful for Uncle Jack's tiny legs. The spa portion also proved challenging to Stan Sitwell and Lucille 2... who, in turn, were being followed by Buster... and G.O.B. And soon, Michael and Tobias awaited their massage therapists."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," So, uh, Tobias, I'm afraid that your wife might not actually end up here with you."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," You know, Michael, perhaps I should buy you that tape recorder. Do you have any idea how often you say the word ""afraid""?"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Well, I-I know I used it in the Jacuzzi."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias, And I apologize for that. I thought it was a pool toy.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," But you were supposed to be here with Sally Sitwell, but you were afraid to ask her. So, what do you do? You create issues, and you make up imaginary problems, like this merger I hear you're worried about."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Well, uh... you're probably right about, uh..."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B., That was the towel guy!
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," ...me being afraid of the word ""no."" But... you know, the merger's real. I'm not imagining that."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B., Lucille! (Sighing.) Michael! (Gasps.) Michael?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, What are you doing here?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Buster, Following Lucille 2. She's with Sitwell.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B., She probably figured that we'd never track her. But we lost her. Everyone put on white robes and outsmarted us.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B., Lucille? Lindsay? (Whispers.) Lindsay?
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," Wait, wait, wait. Lindsay's here? With two men?"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Buster, Sort of one and a half.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Tobias? Hey, Tobias?"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," Lindsay! Look, I... Oh! Lucille 2! I'm sorry. And Miss, I-I don't know your name."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Tobias? Lucille... Sitwell, what's this?"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lucille 2," It's our romantic getaway, Michael."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Romantic? So... then, the company isn't... being taken over? So, Lindsay doesn't have to be with Uncle Jack? Oh, Tobias, we've got to stop Lind... Tobias? Tobias?"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Buster," How'd you like to take a nap, baldy?"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B.," I'll handle this. She's my girlfriend, pal. Take him down, Buster."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Buster, Your girlfriend? That's why you were in her robe and slippies. You weren't trying to get into her head. You were trying to get into her... robe and slippies. She's my girlfriend! (Grunting.)
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," So, this is who you choose over me?"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Uncle Jack, She's not with him! She's with the Bullet!
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," Oh, thank God."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Uncle Jack," But if you want a fight, you've got it. Shoot me! (Grunting.)"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lucille 2, (Yelling.) Stop it! Stop it! Look... 
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lucille 2, I wasn't trying to sell your company. But I am now. The hell with all of you!
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Stan Sitwell, I'm gonna try and low-ball her.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",G.O.B., Not while we're around.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Buster," We're not done here, G.O.B.!"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Tobias... Tobias, I'm sorry. I set this up for Lindsay. Lindsay, I'm sorry. You were not on a date with Dragon."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay," I know that, Michael. It was pretty obvious when Dragon kept swooping Uncle Jack in for a kiss. You said I never did anything for the company. I-I just thought I'd try. But Tobias... I never thought you'd ever fight for me."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias, I had no idea a 90-year-old man could cave in my chest cavity like that.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay," Dragon, would you mind carrying my husband to the car?"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," (Groans.) Oh, God!"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Uncle Jack," I love takin' a guy down. I think I snapped one of his ribs. No, it's my leg. Bet that would hurt."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," I guess the deal's off now, now that I actually need you to help us out?"
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Uncle Jack," I'll make you a deal. You carry me, and I'll carry you."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael," Thanks, Uncle Jack."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Uncle Jack, Yeah.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, Let's see here...
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Uncle Jack, I think we should get to the hospital. This duct tape is the only thing that's keeping the ankle on.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Michael, Okay.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Uncle Jack, (Grunting.) Right around there. Oh! I think you're right inside me now.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, Uncle Jack buys the company, but makes some changes of his own, ..."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Lindsay, And he's gonna make me President. (Laughs.)
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator," ... Tobias listens to a day's worth of his own words, to see what Michael was referring to, ..."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," (On tape.) ...even it means me taking a chubby, I will suck it up."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias, Nothing wrong with that.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias," (On tape.) Oh, I've been in the film business for a while, but I just can't seem to get one in the can."
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias, It's out of context.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias, (On tape.) I wouldn't mind kissing that man between the cheeks.
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Narrator, (... and he realized there is something distinct about the way he speaks.)
2,"Ready, Aim, Marry Me","https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Ready,_Aim,_Marry_Me",Tobias, Tobias... you blowhard!
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Sally Sitwell, I still can't believe we got in. This place is usually so packed on Sundays.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, In addition to its Sunday popularity The Bistro was also famous for something called the Skip's Scramble. An egg dish that contained everything on the menu. Don't order the Skip's Scramble.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, Just more great luck. Everything's been going so well since we started going out. I think we've actually gone out eight times now.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, Which included a record-tying three lovemaking sessions in one night for Michael.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, Yes!
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Sally Sitwell, Just think how different everything in our lives would be if we'd gotten together in high school.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," Of course, I wouldn't have had George Michael. We probably would have had an entirely different kind of child. I really hope he's okay with us going out. We're very close. We don't keep anything from each other."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George Michael," Oh, no, it's my dad. I'm supposed to be at work."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maeby," You know, George Michael, you worry too much. It's Sunday. You're allowed to have a couple of hours off. You don't see me nervous about being on my third Virgin Mary."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George Michael, Why would you be nervous? There's no alcohol in a Virgin Mary.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maeby, There isn't? This is unbelievable. Can I get a Virgin Pina Colada when you get a chance? Now we'll get things started.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," Hi. This is so... So I was just... Hey, okay. I want to introduce you to Sally. This is George Michael, my niece Maeby."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Sally Sitwell, It's nice to meet you.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George Michael, I just shut down the banana stand for a half an hour. I can keep it open late tonight if you...
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," No, no. Hey, come on. Make me sound like a taskmaster. If you want to keep it open an extra hour, you know... So this is Sally."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George Michael, Is she your girlfriend?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, No. Yes! A little.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Sally Sitwell," You know what, I'm going to meet you in a few minutes, okay?"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, Okay.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Sally Sitwell, And maybe we'll work on breaking that record.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," Okay. She's a shot-putter. And I'm dating her, but I just want to make sure that you're comfortable with everything."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George Michael, Of course. We could double-date- you and Sally and me and Ann.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, Who?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George Michael, Ann.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, Yes.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George Michael, And we had...
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," Yes. Of course I know Ann. Didn't mean ""who."" I meant, uh... ""her."" That's a great idea. I love Ann."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George Michael, Great.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," Excuse me, ma'am."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Ann," George Michael, you said that you couldn't come to church because you were working. Now you're doing neither. That's quite a lot of sins for a Sunday afternoon, don't you think?"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Waiter #4, Your Virgin Pina Colada.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Ann, And now you're drinking?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George Michael," We're just having a little fun, you know."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Ann, I think that church and studying are fun. I thought you felt the same.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George Michael," Well, I do. I like not having fun. I like your idea of fun... I mean, our idea of fun. I like not having that."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Ann, I'm going back to church.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maeby," Well, she just killed my buzz. So, you're still enjoying this relationship?"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George Michael," You know, I mean, I guess we've lost some of the heat since we have kissed. I mean, how do you relight that fire? But I can't break up with her. I always assumed she would break up with me."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maeby," Well, we may have to find a way to speed that process up."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator," And later that day, Michael caught Lindsay up on the emotional bond he was forming with Sally."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lindsay," Aw, big deal. Three times. I've had three times plenty of times."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lindsay, Yes!
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Tobias, Did you call my name?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lindsay, Absolutely not.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, I just hope that George Michael is really okay with it.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lindsay," You know, I think you're looking for a reason this isn't going to work, because you can't handle happiness. And you like to suffer."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,G.O.B.," Oh, how delicious."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," No, hey... Let's not spin in the comfy chair."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,G.O.B., Look at this delicious piece of irony. I'm being sued for divorce. Me.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, Thought you were single?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,G.O.B.," Yeah, I keep forgetting that I got married."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator," G.O.B. met a woman one night, and after a series of escalating dares married her."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,G.O.B.," Yes, but it's all coming back to me now. She was a seal dealer. She raised and sold seals to aquariums and marine parks, that sort of thing. Then she went off to fight her war and left me to look after them."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, It was while in the service that her penchant for daring found an natural outlet.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, I've never known you to look after a seal.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,G.O.B., Turns out it's a major hassle. Tried to include one in my act once. There is a reason you don't typically see live seals in a magic show.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,G.O.B.," So with a simple wave of my... Oh, look-it... over there. One of the Desperate Housewives. So desperate."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,G.O.B.," So I released them from whence they came, and now she's stomping on my heart."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, What's her first name? Quickly.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,G.O.B., Krindy.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," Her name's not Krindy, G.O.B."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,G.O.B.," if her name's Amy, I'll call her Blamy."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," That's a strong defense. I'll tell you what, I'll help you look for Barry tomorrow. I think Dad prepaid him for Lindsay and Tobias' divorce anyway."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lindsay, Look at us. Three relationships all falling apart. Maybe it's time we actually took some responsibility for that.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,G.O.B., I think it's Mom's fault.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lindsay, I was going to say the exact same thing.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," No, that's not a spinner."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille, So this is how my children speak of me when I'm not here.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," What are you doing here, Mom?"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille, Your brother Buster wants to meet me at the beach tomorrow. Do you know what this is about? Because if it's about going in the ocean the answer is no-he's not going in the ocean.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," Well, there are bigger dangers, Mom, like say, signing him up for the army during wartime."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille, What the hell was I supposed to do? Michael Moore confronted me in front of the whole country.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," First of all, it wasn't Michael Moore. It was a Michael Moore look-alike, and it wasn't in front of the whole country. It was for a bit on Jimmy Kimmel Live."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille," I don't know who that is, and I don't care to find out."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator," But the next day, she did find out what Buster wanted."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Photographer," Okay, I think we have enough of you two kissing."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille, I can't believe you hired a photographer. We haven't done this since the Balboa Bay Window magazine.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Buster, So I wanted you to have a recent picture of me because they want to ship me out tomorrow. With Army.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Oscar, What? To where?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Buster," Iraq. I just might be out of options. I don't want to go, but..."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille," I know what this is about. You want to go swimming in the ocean. Well, you can forget it."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Oscar, I don't think that's what this is about.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille," Yes, it is. He's trying to punish me or something. Whatever happened to ""Keepin' It Fresh""?"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Buster," I was 30 years old then, Mother. I'm 32 now! And I'm not trying to teach you a lesson."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille," Well, I may not have been a perfect mother, but you know kids don't come with a handbook."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator," In fact, there are thousands of books written on child rearing. But Lucille was in denial."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille," If he wants to go swimming, let him."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, And Buster was far from ready to go swimming in the ocean.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Buster, Bye. (Screaming.)
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator," And later, Michael and G.O.B. tracked down their attorney- Barry Zuckerkorn."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Barry, Thank you so much for coming down here. I've got a big case. I'm representing Skip Church's restaurant.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, I don't care.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Barry, A waitress that works there is claiming that by eating Skip's Scramble several times a week is making her a fatty.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, We need to speak to you about getting a divorce for G.O.B.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Barry," I got Michael out of his marriage, didn't I?"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, Actually she died.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Barry, You're kidding me. I've been taking credit for that for years.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, Credit?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Barry, Who's their lawyer?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,G.O.B., Saul Zentsman. You know him?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Barry, I have Chinese with him every Friday night at Miss Temple's. He's tough.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,G.O.B., I just want my wife back.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Barry," Hey, let's save it for the stand, okay, Tom Jane."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Barry, Fine. I'll get into this as soon as I lose this case. You know who'd defending the fatty? Maggie Lizer.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, Maggie Lizer- our old prosecutor?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator," Michael had an affair with Maggie Lizer while she was both pretending to be blind, and prosecuting the family. It was with her he'd first set the three time record."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, Yes!
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, Their relationship ended somewhat abruptly.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," Wow, how does she look?"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Barry," Well, she's got... If you ask me, bigger."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, She was bigger...
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Judge Ping, Are you sure you're okay to go on?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, ...because she was pregnant.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," It's not my belly we have to worry about, Your Honor. It's Loretta's. Being tempted day in and day out by those Skip's Scrambles. Bring 'em in, boys."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Barry," Oh, I'm cooked. They love her. To tell you the truth, I preferred it when she was blind."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, And so Michael caught up with his one-time lover.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," How you doing? Wow, you look fantastic."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," Wow, I haven't seen you since we had an affair and you ruined my career."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," Yeah, I was going to call you a couple times, and then I just... I just... I got to thinking that... what if she brings that up?"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," To tell you the truth, I am so relieved not to be pretending to be blind anymore. It's actually taught me not to rely on cheap tricks to get the jury's sympathy."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Juror #4," I'm sorry. I know I'm not supposed to do this, but we just spend so much time in that box. I knitted you something."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," (Gasps) Oh, Juror Number Four! Gosh, thank you. I feel so bad I fought so hard to keep you off the jury."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Juror #4, Oh
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Judge Ping," Ms. Lizer, can I see you in my chambers?"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," Oh. Yes, Your Honor."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie, I know. I'm so big now.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," Oh, Chip, you know what? Can you take this back to my house?"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie, (Strains)
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," Actually, it's been about eight and a half months."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," No. You thought I was blind, remember? Don't worry. You're not the father, Michael."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie, No problem.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," Michael, I haven't heard from you. I-I really don't want to hear from you now. Listen, if you're interested, come to the baptism. You can hurl a Bible at the baby."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille," Oh, you're sounding like your uncle. And I've had enough of his attitude, too."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Oscar, The boy is going to war. You're going to have to face that.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille, It's none of your business.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Oscar, He is my boy. I need macaroons.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille," Oh, you're high."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Oscar," You can win every argument like that, but that does not make you right."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille, I don't want you telling him you're his father. I need ice.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Oscar, Can't you see you're in denial?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille, You're high!
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Oscar, You're drunk!
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, Where did Buster say he was going?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille, Iraq. Which is a shot at your father. Thank God he's not here to hear this.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, Excuse me one second. The pipes.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Tobias," You know, Mother Lucille, there's a psychological concept known as denial that I believe you're evincing. It's when a thought is so hateful that the mind literally rejects it."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille," You are a worse psychiatrist than you are a son-in-law, and you will never get work as an actor because you have no talent."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Tobias," Well, if she's not going to say anything, I certainly can't help her."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, And Maeby saw a way to help her cousin.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maeby," I know how to get rid of Ann. You put her in a room with Gangee, she'll criticize her away."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George Michael, But what would Gangee have to criticize about Ann?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maeby," Oh, George Michael..."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator," In the attic, Michael met with George who'd overheard about Buster."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George, He can't go. You can't let him. I command you.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, I really hate it when you put on the God costume.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, George had always worn the God costume at the annual Living Classics pageant where he and Buster recreated Michelangelo's The Creation of Man.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George, What if I never get a chance to reach out and touch that hand of his again? I got to go to him.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," Pop, you're a wanted man. You cannot risk leaving the attic all the time."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George," Oh, when? When have I ever left the attic?"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, Two days ago. Right? I saw you floating around a Ford dealership.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George," Yeah, well, have you seen the new Mustang? You could hump that hood."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, And Michael set the plan in motion to get Maggie out of her house.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," Hi, Maggie. Are you blind again?"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," For the pizza guy. I give him a five, I tell him to keep the change."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," What are you doing here, Michael? I'm with a client."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Loretta, Is that the pizza?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," No...! You'll get your pizza. She's taking the stand tomorrow, I want to make sure it creaks."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," There's so much I don't understand about the law. Look, Maggie, if this child is mine, I really need to know. So what do you think, can you spare a few minutes for someone who might be the father of your baby?"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie, Of course I can.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, Okay.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie, But it's not you.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," Oh, for God sakes."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Loretta," Oh, come on!"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie, Fine. Let me get Loretta out of here and I'll meet you in the car.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator," Meanwhile, on the other side of Maggie's house, Lindsay and Tobias were putting their plan into action."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Tobias, I'm cloaking myself in her scent.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lindsay, She's not blind.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Tobias, She was when she bought this.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lindsay, (Laughs.) You're bad.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lindsay," (Whispers.) My God, that's her!"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Tobias, Get in the tub.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator," Buster, meanwhile, received an unexpected visitor."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George, I want you to know that it is okay for you to hide. A man can hide. There's a quiet courage in that.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Buster, You're a good uncle.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George, I'm not your uncle. I'm your father.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Buster, What?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,George," Shh! Shh! Quiet courage, quiet courage. Hide."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, But Buster was confused.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Buster, You lied to me. Uncle Oscar is my father. He just told me so. And maybe you're not even my real mother. For all I know Lucille II is my real mother! Oh.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille," Buster, you were never supposed to know."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Buster," Oh, yeah, well, here's something you should know- I'm going to war!"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, Buster had just discovered he'd been lied to by his parents.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Buster, I'm going to war!
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille, You told him you were his father.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Oscar, I did no such thing.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille, You're high!
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Oscar, You're drunk!
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille, George. He must have come here to say good-bye to Buster.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, And that's when Lucille snapped out of her denial.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille, My baby's going to war.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, Lindsay and Tobias were gathering evidence that Maggie was truly pregnant. And they were having fun doing it.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lindsay, That's the first time we were in the shower since our honeymoon.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Tobias," And this time, no tears."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lindsay," Tobias, this is the box that Michael was talking about. 60 pounds."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, But it didn't weigh 60 pounds.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lindsay, (Scoffs.)
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator," Michael was stalling Maggie, and they were also having fun."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," Sally Sitwell? You know, I think I had her little play oven."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," It's a funny name, but she's a doll."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," Yeah. I had one. You pull her hair, she'd cry or something."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," This one kinda does that, too."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, (Into phone.) Hello.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lindsay," We got the pee, and we're going to get it checked, but, listen, you should know that that box that says 60 pounds- it's actually like two pounds. I think she's pregnant, Michael. I mean, there's baby stuff here and... Tobias, stop it! That's for the baby. It's not for the... Oh! We're having a really good time."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," Yeah? Well, I kind of am, too."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lindsay, Bye.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," So, no more lies. Tell me the truth. If that baby is mine, maybe we're meant to be together."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," Of course it is, Michael."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, But that's when the Fünkes discovered what was in the box that was so easy to lift.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lindsay," Okay, the box was light, 'cause it had a fake stomach in it, so it looks like she's faking it. God, I hope you get this."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Tobias," Wait up, please."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator," And George Michael and Maeby brought Ann to the penthouse, in hopes that Lucille would drive her away."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maeby, Isn't Ann great?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille," Oh, she's lovely."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator," Unfortunately, she was distracted by the thought of losing Buster."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maeby," Hey, do you have any bread pudding? 'Cause, uh, you'd be surprised how much this one can put away."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille," Now that Buster's not here, there's no one to finish it. I don't care if I ever eat again."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Ann," You know, when times are tough, you can always turn to the power of prayer."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maeby, Here we go.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille, Show me.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator," This was a big ""get"" for God."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, And Michael brought Maggie home to meet his son.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael, This is gonna be easy. He's been signing off on everyone lately. Maybe he called.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," Hey, listen, so what's the deal on Zuckerkorn? 'Cause, you know, my fat case? It's really pretty thin."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," Lying, untrustworthy..."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," Yeah, plus, I heard he hangs out at rest stops."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," No, no, I'm talking about you, Maggie, and I don't know why I'm surprised. I shouldn't be. You're a liar. You lie."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," Wow, I mean, I heard he hangs out at rest stops, okay?"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," And I keep buying it, too. And so maybe there is something wrong with me. I really thought we were starting to trust each other. And I just got a message from my sister saying there's a box at your house with a fat suit in it. What do you got- like a different one for each trimester?"
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie, You had your sister break into my house?
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Michael," Which one are you wearing right now? Is this the ready-to-burst model? Now, there's zero trust here. Good-bye. It's been fun... not."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, Michael had hoped something more dramatic would have come out of his mouth. Or at least more current.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Maggie," Oh, you're so right, Michael. I really can't be trusted. Because I'm faking it. Not."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Tobias," Hello, Michael! Well, my wife and I finally had the thrill of seeing a plus sign on a pregnancy test."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lindsay, You're going to be a daddy!
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, Barry gets a big break on his case..."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Barry," The fat girl in my Skip Church's case? Not fat. Her attorney bought her a fat suit. Oh, I got another case! Maggie is suing you for paternity."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator," ... and for the first time, Lucille prays, ..."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille, Take something else from us. Do whatever you have to to keep my boy from going to war.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator," ... and Buster is on his way when he decides to pursue a long-delayed rite of passage, ..."
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Person, Loose seal! Watch out for loose seal!
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Buster, I don't care about Lucille! She lies!
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Narrator, ... and then a seal bites off his hand.
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Buster, (Yells.)
2,Out on a Limb,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Out_on_a_Limb,Lucille, Amen.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," George Michael, are you around?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, Michael was looking for his son with whom he had a secret to share.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," There you are. Hey, pal, you alone?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael," Almost always, yeah. You know, Maeby's never around anymore, and Ann's off with her religious group trying to get Nip/Tuck taken off the air."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, They don't like Nip/Tuck?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael," Well, you know, they don't like anything. Something about God wants people to age naturally or, I don't know. Ironically, she likes Gangee."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael," Yeah, and you don't have to do that."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Great, because I didn't do it this time. I kind of reconnected with that blind prosecutor I used to date, Maggie Lizer."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael," Her? Didn't she turn out to not to be blind, though?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, Exactly.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael, But she's filled out a little bit.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," Michael hadn't seen her in 8 and a half months, during which she had filled out."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, Really? Could have sworn it was a year.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," See, that's what I thought. Boy, you really are my kid."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael, Good.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Apparently, so is this one."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, Michael found this out after having Lindsay and Tobias break into Maggie's house and hide in the bathroom to collect and test her urine. It was there that they stumbled upon a fat suit.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Tobias, That's what it is.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, Michael confronted Maggie about this.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie," Oh, you're so right, Michael, 'cause I'm faking it."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, But he was proven wrong.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie, Not.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael," Maybe it'll be exciting, you know, be a big brother."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," It'll be fun. There you go! Would be fun, wouldn't it?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael, Big brother- me.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Not going to happen, though, because she doesn't want anything to do with me. But look, I know you've been bored. You and I are going to have some fun together. Maybe we'll even have ourselves a little adventure. Meanwhile, I guess this family's big enough, huh?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," In fact, Michael's family had just gotten a little smaller."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, Hello.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille, (Shrieks.)
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Mom, you've got to stop starting conversations like that."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille, Something happened to Buster! He lost part of his body. I don't know which one.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Oscar, The hand.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille," I told him to stay out of the ocean, but we had a fight. Who remembers about what?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, I do. Buster had discovered that his Uncle Oscar was his true father.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster, You lied to me.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille, You were never supposed to know.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster, I'm going to war!
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," As an act of defiance to Lucille, he first went swimming in the ocean, where he was attacked by a loose seal."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille," If only your father was here. Oh, that George. God only knows where he is."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Oscar, The car!
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George," Up yours, granny!"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille, You couldn't handle it!
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," In fact, George had snuck out of the attic and gone to a local Ford dealership."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Car Salesman, The Bronco's been discontinued. We're trying to shed that whole fugitive on the run thing. This is the Escape.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George, What a fun name. May I test drive?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George," Up yours, granny!"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille, You couldn't handle it!
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," Soon, Michael and George Michael arrived at the hospital."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille," If something happens to Buster, I'll be lost."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, Excuse me.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille," George Michael, you're going to have to be the baby of the family."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael," Um, Maeby's younger than me."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille, You're never going in the ocean! Never! You're my baby. I'm never letting go. You're my baby now! You're my baby now!
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Mom, he is not yours!"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille, The hell with all of you. I have a man. (Gasps.)
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Dr. Fishman, Excuse me. Are you the Bluths?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille, Not Dr. Wordsmith.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Dr. Fishman, He's going to be all right.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lindsay, Finally some good news from this guy.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael, There's no other way to take that.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Dr. Fishman," That's a great attitude. I got to tell you, if I was getting this news, I don't know that I'd take it this well."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille, But you said he was all right.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Dr. Fishman," Yes, he's lost his left hand. So he's going to be ""all right."""
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille, You son of a bitch. I hate this doctor!
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lindsay, How do we keep getting this guy?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Mom, he's a very literal man."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Dr. Fishman," Yes, that's more the way I would take the news."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, Seal with the bow tie?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster, Yeah. I think that's what I saw bite me. Now I just wish I could remember why I went in the ocean. Did we fight or something?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille," Of course not. Although, I always have warned you against the ocean. So has your father."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster, My father...
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille, George You need more juice. Where's the juice?! Give my son the juice!
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster," I'm fine. This is a blessing. And speaking of blessings, I heard there's gonna be a baby. (Laughs.)"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Oh, yeah. Yeah. But don't-don't, please, don't worry about that. What's more important is you're really doing well with this, pal, and my hat is off to you."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster, And my hand is off to you. (Laughs.)
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," (Forced laugh.) No, no. I meant don't get your hopes up about that..."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster, Hand transplant?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," No, the baby. The mother doesn't want me around. We kind of had a little bit of a fight."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster," You obviously care about this Maggie woman, don't you?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Yes, I do. Of course I do."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster," I mean, a seal didn't bite your Linus off, did it?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," No, a seal didn't bite my Linus off."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Yeah, and maybe I'll get one for my brother while I'm at it. (Laughs.)"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster, Get him out of here.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, Hmm?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster, Get him out of here! Get the bleep out of my room!
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," So, at his brother's suggestion, Michael went to the courthouse determined to win Maggie back."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, Have you seen Maggie? It's kind of important.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Barry," Oh, you just missed her. She's in the bar. What a spanking I gave her in court today. Go get 'em."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Judge Ping, Did you spank her?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Barry," No... You know that waitress she's representing is suing my client for making her fat. But here's the thing, Loretta is not fat. Maggie bought her a fat suit, and I've got the receipt to prove it."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Barry," It's Friday night. You might want to try Miss Temple's. Tell her Barry said, ""Ooh, I did good today."""
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, And Michael caught up with Maggie.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," There have been lies, yes, but it's not like either one of us would ever do anything to hurt the other person, you know? Hello, Officers."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Taylor," Well, there's no further sign of a break-in at your house. And since you haven't called us back, we again left the number in case there's a problem."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie," Thanks, Officer."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Carter," Just, uh, next time, call us back."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Hey, break-in? I told you that was us."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie," Well, maybe I did want to hurt you because I was hurt. I mean, the only reason you're here is out of loyalty to the baby."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," It's not just about the baby. Maggie, there was a reason that you and I got together in the first place when we made this baby, okay? There's something here. As long as we never lie to each other again."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie," Well, then I have to come clean about one more thing."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Oh, no."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie, You're not the father.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, Come on.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie," I went to a sperm bank, okay, the week before we even met. The father's some guy from Harvard, but that's all I know."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, That's great. It's probably some geek Simpsons writer's kid.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, Michael had always thought of himself as that great a guy. The kind of guy who could raise someone else's baby.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, Of course I am.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," But he wasn't, and he regretted it the moment he said it."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," The next day, the family gathered to welcome Buster home from the hospital."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille," He's coming. What he's wearing is temporary, please don't comment on it. Or salute him like that idiot guard down there did to him."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Oscar, Look who's back. Let's all say hello.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster," And while you're at it, let's all give me a big hand."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille," George Michael, get your uncle a bandage for his forehead."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Oscar," And while you're at it, get two."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael," Oh, my God."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster," I guess this means you don't want to play ""Got your nose"" with me."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B.," What's the matter, Buster? Did you hurt yourself?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster," Hi, G.O.B.."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B.," Oh, my God! What happened to your...? He's got no hand!"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Buster went swimming in the ocean and according to him, a seal with a bow tie bit off his hand."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B., Bow tie?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Tobias," It's merely the playful mutterings of the shock victim. A seal would never prey on a human, unless, of course, it had acquired a taste for mammal blood."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, G.O.B. had recently dressed a seal in a bow tie and used him in a magic trick.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," When it failed, he released the seal into the ocean."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B.," You're back in the real world. You're not going to be hand-fed anymore! I mean, how the hell would a seal know how to tie a bow tie anyway? I can barely tie the yellow one that I wear in my act."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B., Really?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," And later, Lucille could not contain her guilt any longer."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille, I did this. I prayed that God take anything he wanted from us so that Buster wouldn't have to go to war.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Mom, after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Okay, you've got a better case than Mom does."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Well, they said if you retrieve Buster's hand, they might be able to do a transplant."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B.," At the very least, I could remove that incriminating bow tie."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lindsay," Well, first of all, I'm sure there are writers on ""The Simpsons"" who aren't geeks, and secondly, I think this commitment you're making is great."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lindsay," Oh, no. You're trying to get out of this, aren't you? I thought you were a good guy."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, I am a good guy.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Tobias, Is he trying to get out of having this baby?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lindsay, We want this child. It's given us a reason to stay together.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," In fact, it was investigating the pregnancy that had re-ignited Lindsay and Tobias' passion."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, It was weird.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, Where's your child?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lindsay," I don't have a child, Michael."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Tobias, Oh.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lindsay, Oh. Did you mean Maeby?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, I did mean Maeby.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Tobias," She's hardly a child, is she, Michael."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lindsay," Yeah, and we know where she is. She's with her debate club, and they're on their way to Sacremende for the semifinals."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," She wasn't. And a Google search of the word ""Sacramende"" only came up with this. In fact, she was overseeing a remake of The Old Man and the Sea for the film studio where she'd bluffed her way into a job."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maeby, What on Earth is taking so long? Am I the only one who wants to get home and see their kids?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," All I'm saying is that Maggie claims that no one else is involved, but what if she's lying again, and there is someone else involved? You know, a boyfriend, a husband, someone that got dumped when something better came along."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lindsay, Of course. Why wouldn't she?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Well, yeah. I'm a good guy, you know. So I'm thinking that maybe you could break into her house again for me and see if you can find some..."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lindsay, Way out of this for you? I don't think so.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," No, I was going to say, find some evidence of who the father is, but forget it. I'll find somebody who wants an adventure. (Whispering.) George Michael, how would you like to get away from Uncle Buster?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael, I'd really like that.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Good. Okay, shh, shh, shh."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," And so with his son's help, Michael went to Maggie's to find some evidence of another man."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael, Who?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, They're this old- never mind.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael, You're not going in with me?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Hm? No, no, I can't fit through that doggy door, but I am going to risk being caught out here. Be careful."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael," Okay, I got a phone number. Let's go. Drive. Let's go. Gas."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, You didn't even go inside.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael, It was taped to the door.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," It's probably the Sparkletts guy. Listen, it's okay. I'm telling you, there's nothing to be scared about. I'm not getting that vibe... (Yelps.)"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Taylor, Everything all right?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Yes, Officer. Just waiting to see if Maggie was home."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Taylor," Oh. I was making sure there wasn't another break-in. Officer Davis is inside with his gun drawn, so, everything's going to be just fine."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Close call there, Bullet. I'm so sorry about that. But listen, I think- I think that you do have something here with this phone number. You know, ""Really eager to hear from you."" You know, that's something a guys would say if he was a father of a child and the mother stopped calling 'cause she found a really good guy, you know. I think this is him. Getting that vibe. We're having some fun, aren't we? I'm really sorry about that."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, ...hoping to recover his brother's missing hand.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B., Looking for the seal that's got the taste for kitty blood. I'll pay you handsomely.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," In fact, the skipper had already rented his boat to be shot in Maeby's film. So neither he nor G.O.B. ..."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B., (Yells.)
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, ... were prepared for the challenges ...
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, ... of using cats to catch a seal.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B., (Yells.) It's like herding cats.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B.," Here's your kitty cat- Ow! Fine, you don't get to be bait."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Joe," Why are there cats in the shot? This is the camera boat. Can you lose the bleeping cats, please?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maeby, Uncle G.O.B.?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B., Maeby?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, And Michael traced the phone number he found on the note to an address.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Thank you, Mr. Parmesan."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Okay. In there is the father of the child that Maggie wants me to help her raise. And he probably doesn't know she's gotten another man involved, so, I want you to stay here. Enjoy the adventure from the car. This one could get a little ugly. Hey, I'd like to see that cop at Maggie's do detective work this good."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Oh, come on. Is this your phone number?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Taylor," Hey, I told you at the bar, I left that on Maggie's door. And why are you hanging around Maggie's house anyway?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, I'm sorry. I'm in this crazy relationship. She wants me to raise this child with her because there's no father...
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Taylor, No father?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, I thought I'd come here...
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Taylor, There's a father. There's two fathers. David.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Carter, I'm making gravy.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Taylor, That bitch is going to keep our child.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Carter, I knew she was up to something.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, Michael had tracked down the couple who'd hired Maggie to carry their child.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, So that's why you guys were staking out her house?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Carter, She hasn't returned our calls. There's something about her I just don't trust.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, I'll say. She said she doesn't know who the father is.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Taylor," In a funny way, neither do we. We just gave her a mixed cocktail- two parts Taylor..."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Carter, ... two parts Carter ...
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Taylor, ...and let her do her thing.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Carter, We decided we'd never want to know which of us is the real father.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Well, why should you? I just hope you find out which one of you can breast feed. (Chuckles.)"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," I'm sorry. I didn't mean... Listen, I don't want you guys to worry about getting that child back from Maggie because I'm going to help you."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Taylor," Wow, what a... good guy."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," I know. And for once, I'm one lie ahead of Maggie Lizer's lies."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," In fact, Michael was one lie behind her."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Barry," And what if I told you that Loretta was not fat but actually a very greedy woman in a very cheap fat suit. What, do you think I'm kidding? Huh?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Loretta, What are you doing?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Barry," Okay, so she's fat."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie," Your Honor, this is an outrage!"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Barry," Wow, did I lose this one."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Judge Ping," Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Barry, You said spanking.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," In fact, Loretta wasn't overweight..."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Loretta," Oh, no, Maggie, my water just broke."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie," Quickly, Your Honor, quickly throw it out."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," ...but was carrying the child that Maggie was supposed to. You see, it was Loretta's urine that Tobias and Lindsay ended up testing. A fact they missed when they were making out in the shower. And Maggie did buy the fat suit to serve as her pregnancy belly."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie," All right, this is going back."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, But soon upgraded to a higher quality latex model.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Loretta, It's time!
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie," Oh, my God, my water broke, too. I'm in labor."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, Maggie wasn't but had not choice but to pretend to deliver at the same time. And G.O.B. caught up with Maeby and made a confession.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B., I think I'm responsible for Buster's hand.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maeby," Yeah, and I'm responsible for an $80 million movie without an ending."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B.," Yeah, I know those problems seem big when you're a kid, Maeby."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maeby," Look, this is kind of weird advice for me to be giving, but why don't you just tell him the truth? I mean, he'll respect you for it."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B.," Thanks, Maeby."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maeby," Okay, now I'm just lying for no reason."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille," Lord, let Buster forget everything. And if you need to take another hand to make that happen, please make it G.O.B.'s."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, It was at that exact moment that Buster did forget he'd lost his hand.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Oscar," (Cries out in pain.) No, stop it, stop it, stop it. Oh, you caught my tendon in your claw!"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster, My claw? (Shrieks.) (Whimpering.) I'm a monster! (Deranged yelling.) (Screams.) (Yells.)
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille, (Yelling.)
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster, (Sighs.)
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B., Hi. There's something you need to know.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Lucille, There's nothing he needs to know. (Sotto voce.) Take his hand. Take it now.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B.," It was my fault. It was my seal. I released him, and he bit off your hand. Wow, the truth feels good."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster, You did this to me?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B., Yeah.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, And G.O.B. was about to experience something that didn't feel that good.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Buster, (Screaming.)
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," Michael, meanwhile, notified the policemen that Maggie was in the hospital."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, I'll meet you there.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Carter, We're on our way.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Taylor, I'm getting goose bumps.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Okay, I'm going to go in there with Maggie. As far as I know, she's already had the kid, okay? We're having some adventure though, huh? You can't say we're not having fun."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Hospital Man," Don't smoke, sonny. (Coughing weakly.)"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie," Michael. Oh, I'm glad you're here."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, Is this our little bundle of... two gay cops' baby.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Taylor, Here it is. This came from our cup.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Carter, That little fella was in our cup once.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, Here's something I think you both need to have.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Carter," Boy, you just can't get off the breast thing, can you?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Okay, where's the baby?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie, I'm not pregnant.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Officer Taylor," But we paid you to do this, Maggie."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie," I know, and I wanted to, but then it turns out I couldn't get pregnant. And I had this client, we were working on the fat case, so I... I outsourced it, okay?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie, Of course not. I'm going to give them their baby. I never thought you'd stick around.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," I'm not going anywhere, baby. What is wrong with me?"
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," Loretta had her baby, and the new family couldn't have been happier. And Michael reunited with his son."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael, Disappointed?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, You kidding me? You're the only son I've ever needed.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,George Michael, That's all the adventure I've ever needed.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Okay. son, I'm going to meet you at the car. ""M""- Main floor. No adventure there."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," But ""M"" didn't stand for ""Main floor"". And Michael said good-bye to Maggie."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie, I know. I've got a problem.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael," Well, we obviously both do. We obviously both crave some crazy complication in our lives. When we're together, it is like..."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie, Magic?
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, I was going to say train wreck.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Michael, No more lies.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," But that, too, turned out to be a lie."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, Buster and G.O.B. find themselves closer than ever, ..."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Dr. Fishman, And there you are. We've removed the hook and there's been no damage.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,G.O.B.," Oh, thank God."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Dr. Fishman," Yeah, he's going to be fine. But unfortunately, you've still got a hook in your ass."
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Narrator, ... and Maggie gets a big surprise.
2,Hand to God,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Hand_to_God,Maggie, You have got to be kidding me.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator," Michael Bluth had gotten up early in the hopes of avoiding his family. His mother, however, was already dressed, made up and waiting for him."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille, Good morning.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, Oh! (Yells.)
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator,30 area.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille, I couldn't sleep. I always get this way before Motherboy.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Oh, God. It's Motherboy already?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille, How the hell are you supposed to dance in here when it's so hot? I'm so hot!
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," If you were hot, Mother, (Voice cracking.) we would win!"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille," It's not just Motherboy. It's Motherboy XXX! And I think with you, I've got a shot."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Oh, no. What, Buster, for the first time ever, doesn't want to do this?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille," No, no, he does. It's just he's been so mopey."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Well, that could have something to do with the fact that a seal ate his hand."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille, I don't know what it is.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, I think that's what it is.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille, Who knows?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, It was that.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, It had happened weeks earlier when Buster went swimming in the ocean against his mother's wishes.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Person, Loose seal! Watch out for that loose seal.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, I don't care about Lucille. She lied! (Yells.)
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, He had become haunted by the loss...
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," (Sees hand chair, screams.)"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, ... seeing reminders of the accident everywhere.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," (Sees stuffed seal, screams.) (Sees ""arm off,"" screams.)"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," Mother, I can't sleep. I may not be able to go to dance practice today."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille," I'm going out. Zip me up. I mean, look how he zips now."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille," Well, I don't see you spending time with him."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, The Bluth children had been uneasy about missing limbs since their father used a one-armed man to teach them lessons.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,J. Walter Weatherman, That's why you don't yell.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," As a matter of fact, I'm going to see Buster today. So you're gonna have to find a different dance partner for Motherboy."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lindsay," Oh, God. Not that ""I'm in love with my mother"" dance thing. I'm so glad there wasn't one of those for daddies and daughters."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille, Of course they have father-daughter dances.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lindsay, They do? He never took me?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille, It was before we did your nose. Toodaloo.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, You're up awful early.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lindsay," Yeah. Well, my marriage is falling apart. Tobias is back with Carl."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator," Tobias had gotten a call from his one-time acting teacher, Carl Weathers."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Tobias," He's directing something for TV. But he thinks he might have a part for me. If this takes off, I might be able to buy you the happiness that you deserve."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lindsay," I mean, he said the same thing when he got cast as Frightened Inmate #2 in that film he got fired from."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, He'd even gotten a vanity plate made up announcing the achievement. And this wasn't the first time.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lindsay, He's so clueless. He's not your real take-charge husband.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," You know, Lindsay, you're still looking for somebody like Daddy. Okay? Now, let's not forget that he was also dismissive and disinterested."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lindsay," No, no. He had good qualities."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator," Actually, George Sr. was secretly living in the attic above them..."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George, Nellie...
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, ...and was starved for company...
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George, (To dolls.) Now... who wants to take their top off?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, ...when George Michael and Maeby came in.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Maeby, So you and Ann are actually going on a Christian camping trip?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael," It's called the Promise Land. You're supposed to make promises about your relationship as a tribute to the generations that preceded you. Hey, there's booze in this."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Maeby, That's the Promised Land that Ann's taking you to? You're going to need this more than Polly here.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George, That one's Polly?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Hey, what are you kids doing up here?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael," We're just looking for the camping stuff. Hey, do you know where the pump is for the air mattress?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," I had to take all pumps out of here a long time ago. Take this down to the kitchen, will you?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, I think it's getting a little too risky keeping you up here.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George," Yeah, you know what's risky? Letting your son go on that church thing."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George," Not for long. They-They're making promises to each other? It's all that fidelity and pledging yourself to a woman garbage. You know, I wine 'em and dine 'em, but I don't let 'em tell me what to do. (To dolls.) I don't let 'em tell me what to do."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Listen, unlike you, I respect my son's choices. (Knocking.) Okay, I don't think you should be going on this Promise Land thing."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael, What? Why? Is this because I'd miss school?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," No, no."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Maeby, You get to miss school for that?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, And that's when Maeby decided to become a devout Christian.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Maeby, Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the ‘T' on it?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, That's a cross.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Maeby, Across from where?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," It-It's not about school, pal. It's more about family. Your Uncle Buster's been very depressed lately, and you haven't visited him. Family first. Or did they not teach you that at the Promise Land?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael, I don't know. You won't let me go.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, (Clicks tongue.) That-a-boy.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator," Michael then went to the office, where he ran into G.O.B."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., Barry come by yet? I-I need to talk to him about my divorce.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator," G.O.B. had once gotten married on a dare, a fact he'd only remembered when he was served with divorce papers."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., That cow is going after me.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, Your wife? She was super-thin.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., She was?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, Yeah.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., What about her cans? She had big cans?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," You don't remember her at all, do you?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.," Hey, it was one night of wild passion."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, And yet you didn't notice her body.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., I like to look in the mirror.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Okay, that would be disgusting if you'd actually slept with her, but I don't think you did."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., I did. And it was disgusting.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator," They didn't, but it would have been."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.," Anyway, remember that seal of hers that I released into the ocean? Bit off Buster's hand?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, Vaguely.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., Her lawyers are claiming that the seal's worth 250 grand. And that's not even including Buster's Swatch.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Listen, G.O.B., if you admit in court that you never consummated the marriage, you could get it annulled and walk away free and clear."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., You just can't deal with the fact that I've got a super-thin wife with huge cans.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Barry," All right, who's ready to show their lawyer some love? The seal? (Laughs.) Must have had a tracking device on it. Someone tracked it all the way to a dock in Dana Point."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," You know if that hand is still intact inside the seal, Buster's got a shot at a transplant."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.," At the very least, we can get Buster's Swatch back, right? Up top. No?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, And Tobias met with Carl Weathers at Burger King.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Carl Weathers, Thanks for meeting me down here at Burger King. I'm trying to get them to underwrite a new TV project I'm working on. Get some money in exchange for setting a scene here at Burger King.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Tobias," Well, as long as you don't draw attention to it."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Carl Weathers," You know, I'm directing an episode of the series Scandal Makers. It's about the Bluth family and your father-in-law's escape from justice. I play the lead, a bounty hunter."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Tobias, Oh.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Carl Weathers, Name of Ice.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Tobias," Oh, no. You want me to play myself, don't you? I swore I'd not go reality. I will do..."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Tobias, I could not betray my family like that.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Carl Weathers," Come on, man. I got every part cast except for George"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Tobias, I want that part.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Carl Weathers, Then sign over the rights.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Carl Weathers," I'm gonna go get a new soda. Hey, you know that you can get a refill on any drink you want here, and it's free?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Tobias, (Laughs.) It's a wonderful restaurant. Mmm!
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, It sure is.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator," George Michael, meanwhile, spent an afternoon with his uncle at his father's suggestion."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael," King me. Oh, my God."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," Oh, oh, God! Oh, I keep forgetting about this hook!"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael," Oh, me, too."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," Well, that's a do-over. So, who should go first? I know, let's, rock, paper, scissors for it."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael," What? No, no. You would have won that."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille," George Michael. Buster, did you at least offer your nephew a bowl of soup?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," Yes, Mother, I did."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, Can I open a can of soup for you?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael, Can it open a can?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," Can what open a can? Oh, God."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael," Oh, God."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael," Actually, I just wanted to spend some time with my knuckle Buster."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," See, Mother? Not everybody is afraid of me."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael," (Mumbles.) Oh, my God."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, (Chuckles.)
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille," Aren't you the sweetest thing, spending some time with what's left of your Uncle."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael," Well, I was actually supposed to go away to the Promise Land this weekend, but my dad didn't want me to. Family first."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille," Well, you've done your duty this week. You're a very sympathetic young man. Very sympathetic. You know what? You deserve to go out of town this weekend. And I'm taking you."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael, Really?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, George Michael should have realized by the sailor suit Lucille dressed him in...
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille, / Don't sit under the apple tree... /
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, ...that he wasn't going north to the Promise Land.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille," / Anyone else but me... / I can't believe you don't know this song, George Michael. / No, no, no /"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator," No, he was going south."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille, / Don't sit under the apple tree... /
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, South... to Motherboy.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, And Michael and G.O.B. headed out to find the seal with the tracking device.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Guess we should call Buster and have him meet us at the dock, right?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., I guess so.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,J. Walter Weatherman, No!
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, Or we could make sure it's the right seal first?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.," I mean, why get his hopes up?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Yeah, that's better."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," Knock, knock."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Oh, God!"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., Monster!
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," Hey, brothers."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, Buster!
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., Monster!
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, Sorry about the window.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, Not a problem.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, I really hate this stupid hook.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, (Laughs.) I certainly can't walk around like this!
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, Why not?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., Very handsome.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," So, listen, we were just going to call you. We think we know where that seal is."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, The seal that did this to me?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, Yeah.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, Take me!
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.," Yes. That's a good idea. Oh, no. I'm gonna go with Barry."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, Don't let him in the car.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.," No, no, you should get in here. I'll have to go with Barry! No, no, there's not enough room for you and me and the stump... Barry!"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator," Tobias had gotten his first speaking role, simply by signing away the life rights of everyone he loved. And now he needed some research."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Tobias," (British accent.) I'm George. Ooh, that's good. That's the voice. I've got the voice."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George, That's not my voice.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Tobias," Oh, my God! What are you doing here?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George," I'm having a bleeping tea party. What does it look like? I live here. You tell anybody, you are dead."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, Tobias saw the raw power of George.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George," Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, A power he needed the man to teach him.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Tobias, That's it.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator," So he explained the project, and George agreed, on one condition."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George," If you play me, you got to play me like a man and not like some mincing little Polly or-or Nellie! I get those names confused. Apology. (To dolls.) Apologies all around."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, And the search for Buster's hand continued.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," I would love to be able to say, ""Look what I've had reattached while you and George Michael were off to Motherboy."""
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, Motherboy? Wait a minute. Mom took him to Motherboy?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, (Laughs.) Oh. He couldn't wait to swoop in and throw on the sailor suit. 'Cause he's not damaged goods.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Wait a minute. I don't want him doing that. You got to go with me down there and help me get him, all right? That place is your scene."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," Face it, Michael. They've won. He's the new Buster."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, This was the worst thing Michael could possibly hear.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Barry," Oh, oh, oh, I'm so sorry. False alarm. What they tracked down was a shark. And he must've bitten off the part of the seal with the tracking device on it. Left flipper."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," So... the seal lost his hand, too."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.," Yeah, poor guy's probably out there without a flipper, swimming around in a circle, freaking out his whole family."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Fisherman, That tracking device tells me he was raised in captivity. There's no way he stood a chance out in the real world.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," See that, Buster? He was a victim, too. You both were too sheltered to learn how to protect yourselves, and we can't let that happen to George Michael."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," I will help you, Michael. We've got to rescue your son."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., And I've got to staple this to a seal.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Barry," And I skipped breakfast, so I'm off to Burger King."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, And Lucille arrived at the hotel where Motherboy was taking place.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille," This is nice, spending some time, just the two of us. Well, bleep me. The exact same color. What are the odds? Not to worry. Gangee brought some backups. We'll get a room so we can change. You think enough time has passed to do Sonny and Cher?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael, Who?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille, We're here for Motherboy.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Hotel Clerk, And you do realize this is not the band.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, Motherboy was also a heavy-metal band that used to rock pretty hard in the '70s. We are legally obligated to make the distinction.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael," You know, maybe I should let my dad know that we're here."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille," Oh, he'll know when we bring home the trophy."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael," Yeah, but... maybe I'll just give him a call."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Hotel Clerk, And what name should we put the room under?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille, Karmopolis.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, And Lindsay was about to see a Tobias with the raw power of George
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lindsay," Tobias, I still do sort of want to talk to you about some things."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Tobias," It's a little late for talk, Lindsay. I'm a man of action now. (Grunts.) (Drops jar into trash.) You don't need the calories. (Whispering.) This isn't working."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lindsay," Is it my imagination, or is he more commanding and-and mannish? It's, like, I don't know, maybe I do want to be with him."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Maeby," Then you should go to him. For as it is written, you shall be with whom you have formed a more perfect union with under God."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lindsay, She's right.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Maeby, (Softly.) This isn't working.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Hotel Clerk," I'm sorry, you've got the wrong Motherboy."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Yeah, this looks like the place."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, And Michael and Buster arrived at Motherboy.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, Excuse me. Has a Lucille Bluth checked in?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Hotel Clerk, I have no one by that name.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," God, she knows you're after her."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, She does?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, Wait a minute. I recognize those outfits. We're getting you out of here!
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Boy Sailor," Thank you, thank you!"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," Oh, God! It's red."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Boy Sailor," Take me with you! No, please, please!"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, It was the wrong child.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, Where do we go next?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," if Mother saw those two, she is going to change clothes, and that means he'll be on the balcony. Whenever she changed clothes, she made me wait on the balcony until zip-up. And yet anything goes at bath time."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, Let's check the balconies.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, And Barry prepared G.O.B. to meet with his wife.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Barry," If you really want to settle this, then your job is to convince that ""wife"" of yours that you are willing to go in front of the judge and admit that you never had sex."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.," She has a name, Barry. You don't happen to know when it is, by the way, do you?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Barry," That's why I want to settle. I'm not ""super-prepared."""
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.," Well, we did have sex... and I'm not a great liar."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, Both things he just said were lies.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., But if you think it'll scare her off...
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Barry," I do, and it will."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Barry, And you don't want to go in front of that judge. I caught him in a drag club.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., What were you doing there?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Barry, Wow... you should be the lawyer.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator," And soon, Michael and Buster surveyed the hotel, looking for George Michael."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, There's a very bored-looking little Sonny Bono on that balcony.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Oh, God, that means she'll be dressed like Cher."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," I have an idea. It is time I used something I trained for in Army, but I never got a chance to do."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Buster, you can't zip-line over there."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," Either I zip down, or he zips up, and that is a mighty long zipper on Mother's Cher jumpsuit. You have to get on your knees to start it."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," This is much less scary. Godspeed, Buster."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, (Screaming.)
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Boy Sailor, (Mumbling.) You came for me!
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille, Zip me up.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille, We're switching rooms again. And costumes.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, Tobias had begun work on the set of Scandal Makers.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Carl Weathers, What's so great about Tobias is he's got this obligation to his wife and his daughter.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Dave Attell," Whoa, whoa, this guy's straight?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Carl Weathers, Yeah.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Dave Attell, Then what the hell am I wearing these for? Look at that.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Tobias," Hey, gang. I'm sorry, I don't want to ""note"" you to death but you should be wearing those, uh, under your pants."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Dave Attell, Why?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Tobias," Oh, it's-it's a thing. There's dozens of us."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Dave Attell," Carl, this whole thing is starting to feel like a real career killer."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Carl Weathers," Yeah, yeah, I know, man."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Tobias, Also...
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Carl Weathers," Uh, Tobias... why don't you go and learn your lines, man, work on them?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Tobias, Did I get lines? (Laughs.) They told me I was just jumping onto a moving staircar.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Dave Attell," If that man's straight, then I am sober."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.'s wife," Hi, um, I'm waiting for ""Gahb"" Bluth."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.," I'm ""G.O.B."" Bluth. My wife send you?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.'s wife, I'm your wife.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., I knew that. Nice to see you again... Usarmy.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.," Lost a lot of weight in Iraq, especially up in the... northern region."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.'s wife," So, where's the seal?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.," Hey, that's not my problem. As far as I'm concerned, we were never even married. Maybe I'll just say that we never... sealed the deal."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.'s wife, You're willing to admit that?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., Lie about it? Yes.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.'s wife, Wow. I mis-underestimated you.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.'s wife, You've got some courage. Makes me wonder what I'm missing.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.," You mean, other than your cans?"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B.'s wife," Oh, they're still here."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, And so G.O.B. set about consummating the marriage he'd finally agreed to claim he hadn't.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,G.O.B., (Chuckling.)
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator," And back at Motherboy XXX, Lucille was finding her new partner an asset."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Woman #1, Is this your son?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille," No, I'm his grandmother. He's an orphan."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Woman #1," Oh, I'm so sorry. Well, you guys should win."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael," Well, I'm not a... not an orphan. I have a dad."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Woman #1," Well, good luck to you."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille," Well, that little bit of honesty helped nothing. You better bring it to the waltz, young man."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator," Meanwhile, Michael and Buster had retrieved Buster's hook and were staking out the situation."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, I don't know. I don't see her.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, The gypsies. They've changed into gypsies.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, My Army training tells me... that this is going to be a hot mission.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, What? A hot mission?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster," Yes. I create a diversion, and you grab George Michael and go. We need a name. Maybe ""Operation Hot Mother."""
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," No, le-let's try to top that."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator," They never did, and later, ""Operation Hot Mother"" was underway. Buster was waiting for Michael's cue to unplug the lights, but that's when Buster caught his hook on a sandbag."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, (Whining.)
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Announcer at Dance," And now, from the land of gypsies, Lucille Bluth and her orphaned grandson."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," What the hell's going on, Buster? Cut the lights!"
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille, Buster?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, Grab him. Take the gypsy boy!
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Come on, I'm taking you out of here. Let's go."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael, But they haven't served dinner yet.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, George Michael.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille, You're not taking him.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, No.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Boy Sailor, Take me with you!
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Hey, what are you doing? I can't."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Boy Sailor, Take me with you!
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Get off of me. Buster, let's get out of here."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, I-I'm stuck. Go. Take the boy. Go!
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Announcer at Dance," All right, Motherboys, our, uh, curtain seems to be stuck. We're going to do some freestyle waltzing while we get it fixed. Boys' choice."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille," George Michael, you're choosing me."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," No, Mom. You had no right to bring him to this freak show. He was supposed to be visiting Buster."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lucille," No, you were supposed to be visiting Buster, but you made your son do it because you didn't want to."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael, You were supposed to do it?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, Y-You didn't want to?
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," No, Buster, I... I didn't know how to, uh, treat you, all right? I thought that you would be a little different, but you're not. I was wrong, okay? I'm sorry, you know? You... you're as good a brother as you ever were."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Buster, (Groaning.)
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael, Okay?

2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Michael," Oh, a promise is a promise. And I'm glad the three of us were able to spend this time together."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,George Michael," Yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah."

2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lindsay," Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I'm in the wrong trailer."
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Narrator, But not the one she's married to.
2,Motherboy XXX,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Motherboy_XXX,Lindsay, So you don't cry when you take those off?

2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," So you still haven't put this stuff back yet, huh? You've got to be the laziest person in the world."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay," If you weren't all the way on the other side of the room, I'd slap your face."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay," Yeah, and you also asked me to call the fumigators, and you haven't even thanked me for doing that."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator," Michael had asked her to do this, but that was long before he began hiding his father in the attic."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George, What the...?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George," Oh, God! Polly, cover your mouth!"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator," Luckily, Michael was notified in time."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, I pay for everything and you clean the house. You've only done it once.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator," She hadn't even done it that time, but instead, intercepted her mother's housekeeper..."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay," Hey, Lupe."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator, ...as she was arriving for work.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay, Can I take you the rest of the way?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lupe, Missus... Missus...
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay," Oh, I have to make one quick stop first."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lupe, Almost done. Yours... or Mister's?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay, (Sighs.) Mister's.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator, Lupe never accepted a ride from Lindsay again.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay," Well, I'm sorry, Michael, but Tobias moving out hasn't been easy."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, For any of us.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay," You didn't even notice he'd gone, did you?"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, I did notice we'd stopped TiVoing The Christopher Lowell Show. What happened?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay, Like what you see?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Tobias, I've been looking for those. You're going to stretch them out.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay, That's all you can say?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Tobias," Well, excuse me for liking the way they shape my junk."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay," I don't know why, but that's it. You can pack your junk and get out."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Tobias, You're kicking me out? At the beginning of pilot season?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay, You're not going to make it as an actor and we're not going to make it as a couple.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, I'm really sorry to hear that.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, How's Maeby taking it?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay, She's really hard to read.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, You haven't told her yet.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay," Well, she was so excited the hot water in the shower was lasting longer. How can I have the heart to tell her it's because her father moved out?"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., Tobias moved out? Did he take the good video camera with him?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," That's really very touching, G.O.B. What do you need the camera for?"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., I'm making a magic video. I'm going to tape myself doing tricks around the office. I'm calling it Tricks... let me finish... Around the Office. I figured out a way to make money while I'm working.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, That is what we call working. Something you might want to try next time you're at the office.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., Fine. I'll vote at your stupid meeting as long as you give me the camera. I think we all know that George Michael was using it last.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator, A fact the family discovered when they gathered to watch a home video.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, Is that Qusay Hussein at the omelet bar?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George," Look at this. These guys move, they don't get paid."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator," It seems that as a 13-year-old, George Michael had been heavily influenced by the Star Wars films, and had endeavored to recreate his favorite moments."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George, I spent $2.1 million of company money and end up with this?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George Michael, My hand! You cut of my hand!
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., Worth every penny. Even you have to admit that that was the lamest thing ever put on tape.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator," Not so. Buster had once videotaped himself recreating moments from his then favorite film, Chicago."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Buster, (Humming)
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator, He also liked Star Wars.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Buster, (Imitating light saber buzzing.)
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," His self-esteem is low enough as it is, and I have no idea why. He's such a great kid, you know. And everybody loves him. He's George Michael. Truthfully, that's why I'm not that crazy about that Ann, but he'll move on."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," Unless he knocks her up like you did with his mother. Plus, she's religious. That one gets pregnant, it stays pregnant. Believe me, I dated a chick like that once in high school. (Long pause.) No, I didn't."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator," Michael went to do so, only to hear Ann beating him to it."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Ann," George Michael, I want you to do it."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George Michael, But I don't think I'm ready.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Ann, Of course you are.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George Michael, I'm going to lose it before I start.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," Don't start. Smoking. It's a killer. That Sammy Davis, Jr. should still be performing. What's going on?"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George Michael, Ann thinks I should run for student body president.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, That's a great idea.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George Michael," I don't have a chance. I mean, they only vote for the cool kids."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Ann, But everyone loves you.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," You are George Michael! Who's cooler than you? Plus, you would be following in your old man's footsteps."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Ann, You were student body president?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," Oh, it was close."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Ann, So you lost?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, Who remembers?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Ann, I know I would remember.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George Michael," Ann, if my dad says that he won, then he won."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," I didn't say I won. I said I can't remember. But now that we're thinking about it, I seem to remember that the other guy won the actual title, although there were plenty in the school that wanted to overturn the decision. I said, ""Let's, do not... Let's not put the school through that."" You know, I haven't thought about that for years. Good memory."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Ann," Well, anyway, I'll help you run your campaign and I'll make your commercial for election day."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," Well, that's great. The important thing is to raise the old self-esteem and not to rush a physical relationship. Those are really the two important things."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Ann," Oh, no. We're-We're both waiting."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, Good.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Ann," And then that first time, after waiting and waiting, it's gonna be so awesome! Because it's not gonna be my love and George Michael's, but God's love, as well. God, it's gonna be incredible!"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George Michael," All right, I'll do it! I'm in."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, Campaign.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George Michael, I'm pumped.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator," As George Michael was on the path to higher self-esteem, Buster was losing what little he had."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lucille," Oh, stop complaining. (Gasps.) Buster!"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Buster," I'm sorry I'm an inconvenience to you, Mother. Oh, God!"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay, Oh.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator, ...she came upon an old friend.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay, I haven't seen this in ages. Ebay!
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator," Unfortunately, it was a new friend to George"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George, Polly!
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator," And back at the office, Michael came to regret having given G.O.B. the video camera."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," Well, I-I certainly appreciate your decision, uh, but if my brother was here, we could have voted this thing through."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," What's this? A stuffy office meeting? Well, maybe it's time for a little office magic."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Ron Michaelson," What's ""office magic?"""
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.,45 in the morning into... lunchtime!
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Ron Michaelson, Why does lunch have to be so dull?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., Maybe you'd prefer some chicken instead.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," All right, let's cut. Um, take five, everybody..."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," No, no, no, we're-we're not taking a five. Hey, is this guy with you?"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," Yeah, he's an actor, Ron Michaelson."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," Well, you know, I-I thought he was an investor. He voted against me, which is the vote that I asked you to be here for, so, no, no. You know what? I don't know why, but that's it, okay? I don't think I can work with you anymore."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," No, no. I'm the president."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," No, you lost the presidency, just like you did in high school when you refused to play dirty like Dad told you to. Worked when I ran."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," I'm talking about the office here, okay? I do all the work; I've been helping you out, but that's over now."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," I'm sorry to hear you say that, Michael, because it just cost you your job."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, I'm serious. It's over.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., How do you call security on this thing?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, You hit pound-0-0 to operate the system...
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," Yeah... Pound is tic-tac-toe, right?"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," I keep hitting that thing, then the other thing flashes."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, You're hitting pound and then 0-0.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., I know...
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," It's really simple. Tell you what, you don't need to learn how to use the system because you're out of here."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., You're fired. Have security send a man up.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., You've got the wrong guy!
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," Uh, no, you don't, but, uh, you don't have to do this."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator, But the guard had recently lost half his tie to office magic.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Security Guard," Oh, I don't mind."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., Get this. Are you getting this?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Gary, Cheat out. You have to cheat out a little. No.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Maeby, What was that all about?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," Your Uncle G.O.B. doesn't not-work here anymore. So I guess your mom told you about your dad moving out, huh?"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Maeby, No. She did not tell me that.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, Oh.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Maeby, But she doesn't tell me anything. Neither of them do.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, I'm sorry. Guess I shouldn't have said anything.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Maeby, Maybe I should just start keeping some secrets of my own.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, Yeah. Why aren't you in school right now?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Maeby, Marry me! I'm so sorry. I forgot who I was talking to.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Maeby, I was just using your copier to make some campaign posters.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," Well, then, by all means. Let me help you."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Maeby," I mean, I don't even know why I'm doing it. He's gonna win by a landslide."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, That's what I was telling him.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Maeby, How do you know Steve Holt? Are you in AA?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, Who's Steve Holt?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Maeby, He's just the hottest guy in school. And he's won three years in a row. Every year after his first junior year.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," So then, he's more popular than George Michael?"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Maeby," Well, that's like comparing apples and some fruit nobody's ever heard of."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," I guess I got to get down to the school and see if I can stop him from signing up, huh?"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, Hmm.

2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lucille, (Gasps.)
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Buster, (Gasps.) Mother!
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lucille, And yet you're too good to polish the candlesticks. You're fired!
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Buster, You can't fire me. I'm your son. I'm firing you!
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lucille, I was firing Lupe.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Buster," Well, that makes more sense."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay, Can't you at least come over and Dustbuster or something?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lupe, I no does Buster anymore.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay, Fine. I'll Dustbuster.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay, God! Hello?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Tobias," Hey, I can't talk loudly. I'm in the bathroom of the Wrench set and they've started shooting. Also, I don't think this is a real toilet. So I just wanted to check on Maeby and tell you that I haven't landed a part yet, but despite what you may think, my talent shall win out."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Frank Wrench," You're a dirty cop, so Frank Wright is going to clean you. Why is this door locked?"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Assistant Director, Cut!
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Frank Wrench, Someone using the set bathroom?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Tobias, I've got to go!
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator, And Michael arrived at school to talk his son out of running for office.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George Michael," It took me all day, but I got the ten signatures I needed. I'm running for student body president."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," Listen, George Michael..."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," No, I just meant that you two should... Uh, you're not gonna put up this poster, are you?"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Ann, I think it's really really going to appeal to the Christian crowd.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George Michael, I couldn't have done this without you guys. I'm going to win this thing.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Crowd, (Cheering.) Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator, And G.O.B. showed up at his mother's.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," Well, guess who's been fired."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lucille, Michael fired you?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," No, I fired him. But as a result, I'm no longer welcome in the office."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lucille, What a coincidence.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lucille, I just fired my housekeeper. But I've already found her replacement.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lucille, It's a robot.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Buster, I hate it. I miss Lupe.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lucille," No, I won't let you go down that road. I want you to be strong, and you don't need the comfort of an immigrant in Mother's old stirrup pants to make you feel that way."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator, Lindsay was about to find a replacement for Lupe as well.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay, Who is it?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Tobias, (In a British accent.) The new housekeeper. The agency sent me over.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay," Uh, I'm sorry. I didn't call any..."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Tobias," Oh, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Phyllida Featherbottom, and I can cook and I can clean and I can take care of the little ones. I can also sing a song or two, if it comes in handy."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Tobias, (Singing.) / When you put a squirt of frosting down your throat / / Before we take our medications... /
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator, Tobias had gotten access to the studio's wardrobe and makeup departments. He was eager to both see his daughter and prove to his wife that he had what it took to be an actor. It was the exact plot of the film Mrs. Doubtfire.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Tobias, (Singing.) / ...In the most delicious way... /
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator, There was also some Mary Poppins in there.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay, Let's get this house cleaned up.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," Hey, Lindsay, the place looks fantastic. What, did you pay somebody to do this?"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Tobias," Oh, I've no need for payment. The love of a family is more than enough."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay," I'm sorry, this is Mrs. Featherbottom."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Tobias," From Blackstool. I'm charmed, I'm sure. Oh! Back to work."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," That's convenient, considering you didn't even have the courage to tell Maeby that he'd moved out of the house."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay," I'm sorry. I'm not the perfect parent, like you."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, I'm not that perfect. I pushed George Michael into running for office and I think he's going to get crushed by this kid Steve Holt.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lindsay," Yeah, I'd vote for Steve. Well, too bad Dad's on the lam. You could finally use some of his dirty tricks to get George Michael elected."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator," As it happens, George Sr. had come to in the attic, and perhaps it was the effect of losing his one friend..."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George, Polly?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator," ...or the lingering effects of the fumigation, or perhaps it really was divine intervention, but he'd had a profound realization. Unfortunately, the timing of the enlightenment wasn't ideal for Michael."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," That's why I need your help, Pop."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George, Our Heavenly Father let his son die so that our sins could be absolved.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," Great, so you're a Christian now."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George, We all must seek forgiveness.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," Well, I'll call the warden for you. You can ask him yourself."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator," Michael realized that he had lived like Gallant, and if he wanted some dirty tricks to help his son's election, he would have to find Goofuth."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," If you came to grovel for the job of president, you're too late; my brother already fired me."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," Listen, I'm really, really sorry I got upset with you. And, uh, I never meant to, um... I didn't even mean to fire you, you know. I just got so frustrated, and G.O.B... you are my brother- of course I'm going to support you."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., Well... now I feel bad for firing you.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," Listen, George Michael is running for student body president and I have a feeling he's going to get slaughtered. The guy that he's running against is basically a young you."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," Wow. Won't be easy to win a race against myself. Of course, if anyone can do it, I can."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, That's right.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., I wish I was 15 years younger.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," And if I do this, you'll rehire me?"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, Of course I will.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," See, the mere fact that you think you can says to me that I shouldn't let you. Of course, we both need the work."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., Robot'll get it.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lucille, Where the hell is my maid? Robot!
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator, But the robot was busy elsewhere.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Lucille, (Gasps.)
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Buster," (Gasps.) Mother. What do you expect, Mother? I'm half-machine! I'm a monster! (Screaming.)"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator, Michael brought G.O.B. in to consult on his son's campaign.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, I think we should focus on the video and shy away from the virgin thing.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," Oh, we should definitely sacrifice the whole virgin thing."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," And I got the perfect way. We hand out rubbers that say, ""We salute George Michael."""
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Ann, We're not even supposed to have outside help.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George Michael, And I don't want to make Steve look bad.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," Yeah, I just don't want my son to be embarrassed up there, so let's not play too dirty."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," Uh, good point, Two Percent."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael," 2%, huh? Is that how little I lost by?"
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., Lost by?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, It was close.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., That's all you got.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, That's not really important right now.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," Well, if your son wants more than 2%, he's gonna have to go after Steve Holt, so I want you to tell me every awful rumor you've ever heard about this kid."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Ann, I can't support this. And neither can the Christian kids that were going to make you president.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George Michael, She's wh... Ann? I think she's really upset about this.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., She'll forgive you.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, You're George Michael!

Please, I want to hear about you. Tell me about your family. I'm sure wherever your father is right now, she loves you very, very much."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Maeby, Not enough to be honest with me.

2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," Yeah, I gave it to the tech guy. Don't worry. It's very tastefully done."

But I finally found a new father. You're probably wondering what these footsteps are. Well, this is my second take. It's kind of like a second chance at making good."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B.," Yeah, okay. We need to pull the videotape."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George Michael, My tape?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, Why?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., I've made a huge mistake.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator, But it was too late to do anything about it.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George Michael, That's why you had me do that?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Narrator, George Michael had never been more embarrassed...

2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,G.O.B., I liked Steve's more.
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, I guess I underestimated the religious vote. So Steve won?
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,George Michael," No, Steve dropped out of the race. He says he wants to spend some time trying to find his real father. Rav Nadir, the Indian kid, he got 97% percent of the vote."
2,The Immaculate Election,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Immaculate_Election,Michael, That leaves 3%. You did better than I did when I ran.S

2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster," Wow, it's warm."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder," Oh-ho-ho. Magicians only. (Whispers to Buster) I folded it up into some squares, and then I put it into a pouch under my shirt, and then I pull it out and I make it look like it came out of my skin."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster," Wow, that sounds easy."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder," Keep it to yourself. And good luck up there tonight. (To G.O.B.) And you... you'll get there someday. I started out as a little ""w."" Somehow I became a big one. I don't even know how it happened, all right? My eye! Aah! Enjoy the Hanukkah cookie, man."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster, And now our magic trick.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster," Silence, slave! In this magic trick I'm going to put a sword through my assistant's tummy."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster, May I have the trick sword please.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster, Whoo.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster, My hand! My hand! (Whimpers)
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder," Bravo. Hey, give us a sec, would you, Candida? My brother's widow. It's bleeped up. Hey, so, the accident angle. Right on."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster, (Stammers.)
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder," No, thank you. The ""How dey do dat's"" ate it up. Sorry, that's what we call the audience."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder, Not registering. But you hitched your wagon to the right star. I want you guys on my next DVD.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder," Actually, some band has got the rights to that title, so I'm thinking like Use Your Illusion 2. But, yeah, meet me out there tomorrow. And if you get thirsty... (Screams in pain) Ah! (Groans) (Groaning continues) (Grunts) Have a free round of drinks courtesy of Tony Wonder."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster, It's a Subway Sub Club card.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster," Oh, it still needs three stamps."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Lucille, He's on his way here. We passed him on the road. He was doing really well. Had his first hop-on.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Lucille," Oh, for God's sake, Tobias is right."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Lucille," You have to control everyone's life. I don't know where you get that from. Oscar, stop licking that sore."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Oscar, I'm not.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Dr Stein," Well, the operation went pretty smoothly. But once I got in there, the appendix wasn't so inflamed. D'oh!"
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Lucille, I knew it.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Dr Stein," And, not so fast, Michael. There seems to be a bacterial infection from the operation which left an abscess in your abdominal wall."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Oscar, Ew.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Dr Stein," I know, it's pretty gross. It could heal on its own, but I say we go in there Dr. Stein style and cut it out. I want to show these interns what the best doctor in Southern California can do."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Dr Stein, I'll check on you soon.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Lucille," Michael, this crazy point you're trying to make about respecting authority is absurd. And one day you're going to wake up and find out it has caused you nothing but trouble."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Oscar, And you are peeing again.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,John Beard," The FBI has pinpointed the location of escaped convict George Bluth today. Thanks to a tape turned in by a rabid and disgruntled employee. The FBI has matched the design of the attic to one of Saddam Hussein's Iraqi houses, and it appears his son is with him."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,John Beard, Booya!
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster, I wonder where he is.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder," Did somebody say ""wonder""?"
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster, He just appeared out of nowhere! In front of that dumbwaiter.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster, You have a piece of lettuce on your shoulder.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder," Ta-da. Part of the trick. So let's get down to business, shall we? Hey, can you go wait with the other assistants over there?"
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster," No. Whatever you say to me, you can say to him. I grant him magic sanctuary."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder," No, that's fine. I second the sanctuary, but with the clause of silence. So I want you guys to be on Use Your Illusion. Only now it's ""allusion"" with an ""a."" So if you guys want to put an allusion in there somewhere, like Poe or something... Don't do Poe, 'cause I'm doing Poe."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster, What about Chaucer?
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder," Just not Poe, okay?"
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster, Okay.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder," And, uh... I don't think we need, uh... your assistant."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster," Uh, clause of silence. Look, my assistant is my partner. I need him."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder," For what, Buster? Huh? You're the magic. Check out those moves you're doing, man. They're in their own orbit. Look at Tiagra, my girl. Don't look at her. 'Cause you look at her and it affects her in a way that I don't feel comfortable with. Or go for it. I don't care. Whatever. I'm just saying it's your..."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Are you telling me that you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities?"
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder, I guess we'll see what you can do then.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder, Ow! Darryl! I told you to move that [bleep]ing chair ten times. And clean the [bleep]ing dumbwaiter while you're at it.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster, Oh. I was really hoping for a graham cracker.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Dr Stein," Morning, sleepyhead."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Dr Stein," Well, we had a little whoopsie. See, we got the abscess, but I think we might have left some snippers in there. It's not very likely, but one of the assistants having taken them is even less likely. Unless I left them in my scrubs."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Lucille, Michael. Good news. They think George is in Iraq. All the pressure's off him.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Lucille," But not to worry. Tobias said he's handling it with the FBI, and the employees have everything under control."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Ted," Oh, hey, Michael. Good news. We leased the top floor to another company, and moved down here. But we can stay in business without having to build the extra houses. We did it. We did it!"
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Buster, (Whimpers)
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,G.O.B., (Groans in agony)
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder, Guy's good. Damned good.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Tony Wonder, I didn't know we had taquitos.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Michael, (Groaning)
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Dr Stein," Your leg's going to be fine, Michael. And I wouldn't worry about getting hit by any more cars. I've shortened your calf muscles to theoretically increase your jumping ability. But if it works, I could be the best in the world."
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Dr Stein, Your fingers have been perfectly reattached. Go ahead. Take a look.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,Dr Stein, Switched. For the first time ever.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,FBI Man #1, It appears there was something else on the video tape. We think it's a terrorist training film.
2,Sword of Destiny,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Sword_of_Destiny,FBI Man #2, This kid's got moves.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," Michael came home to find his brother-in-law Tobias, who'd been kicked out of the house earlier that week."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Tobias, Michael. How are you?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, I'm good. Good. Didn't I already see you today?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Tobias, Not that I know of.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator, Michael had seen him earlier that day as Tobias had been posing as an English nanny named Mrs. Featherbottom...
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Featherbottom," Okay, who'd like a banger in the mouth? Oh, right. I forgot. Here in the States, you call it a sausage in the mouth."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, We just call it a sausage.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," The family, of course, knew it was Tobias, but the house had never been cleaner."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Tobias," Hello, young lady. I haven't seen you in a week."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Maeby," Oh, right. That means Mrs. Featherbottom isn't here. Which means she didn't iron my blouse, which means, I don't have anything to wear for my premiere. The premier. Of Canada. He's going out with my gym teacher."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator, Maeby was actually referring to the premiere of a film from the studio where she had conned her way into a job.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Maeby, History in Perspective?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Jeff The Reader," Yeah, I looked that up. It's a ninth-grade history textbook."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Maeby," Yeah, and if I don't get your report on it, I won't be able to pass. On it. Because I have a feeling it's a piece of bleep."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," Unfortunately, the job was wreaking havoc with her language."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Maeby, Maybe we just need a new bleeping housekeeper.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Tobias," Okay. I'm sure she would've ironed it for you had you told her about it before she changed out of her bloody work clothes, but... I am off, then."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Maeby," Well, I gotta keep him trying, and that is the job."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille," Michael, what are you doing tomorrow?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Having my day ruined with whatever you're about to ask me to do.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille," It's my wedding anniversary, and Oscar wants to throw me a party."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," He is aware that he's not married to you, right?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," In fact, Oscar had started to perceive that Lucille was pulling away from him."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille, Not now. It's my time of the month.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille, Not now; I don't want to risk having a baby. It could kill me.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," So, he went to Buster for advice."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar, I think she misses my brother.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Buster, My father?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar," Yes? (Dramatic music.) I mean, yes."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar, Maybe I should throw her an anniversary party.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Buster," Oh, so when he doesn't show, she'll realize that you were the one who was always there for us."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar," Well, I was thinking one more party, and then I'd move out. But no, I like your plan better. The only problem is, we know he's around somewhere."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Buster," Well, he never came when I lost my hand. But you- you not only embrace it, but I saw you kissing it while you thought I was sleeping. (Chuckling.)"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar, (Sucking.)
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille," Who knows what goes on in that pot-addled mind of his. Anyway, it's a party, and I want the whole family there."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B., We're having a party?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille," No. Well, I'm sorry if I don't want you doing one of your stupid puppet shows."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," I did that once, Mom. And a lot of people thought it was pretty cool."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator, In an effort to hip up his act... G.O.B. had briefly introduced a puppet.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," (as Franklin) Can I tell you somethin', my man?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," Sure, Franklin."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," (as Franklin) You are one cool [Bleeps] Speakin' of mothers, let me give that oatmeal some brown sugar."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar," Get off my wife, you bastard!"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," Oh, man. What's the matter with you?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B., Franklin said some things Whitey wasn't ready to hear.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," G.O.B., weren't you also mercilessly beaten outside of a club in Torrance for that act?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B., He also said some things that African-Americany wasn't ready to hear either.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," You know, Mom, we have no idea where Dad is. How's he gonna hear about the party?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille, Why do you have the baby monitor out?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," I'm, uh, listening in-"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,"George, Sr.", She wants her man back.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, On my son.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,"George, Sr."," Yo, man. You're gonna get your sorry white ass thrown in jail. I said that's enough."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator, Michael came up with an excuse he knew his mother would understand.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," I'm listening in on my son. I'm a little worried about his girlfriend, Ann."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille," My advice, get one of those teddy bears with the cameras in them. I had one in Buster's room to make sure he wasn't getting too serious with anyone. As it turned out, he got too serious with the teddy bear. I'll see you at the anniversary party."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael, Gangy's having an anniversary party?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Seems that way.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael, Is Franklin gonna be there?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," See that, Mike? Kids love Franklin."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael, I just don't want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B., Imagine what he'd say about her.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lindsay, So you were listening in on George Michael. Can you believe what he asked me this morning?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael, Do you think my mom's engagement ring is still around?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lindsay, Of course it is. Your father would never part with something so precious.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," In fact, Lindsay was currently wearing it on her middle toe, roast beef."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael, I'm thinking of asking Ann to get pre-engaged.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lindsay, You are?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael, Yeah. I feel like God moved her here from Ohio to be with me.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,"George, Sr.", Her?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Well, that's the first I've heard of this."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lindsay," Well, then who said ""Her?"""
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Me. That was-That was me. But, um, her?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lindsay," Look, it's just a pre-engagement. It's exciting. You know, it's young love. I had it once. A man I loved-"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Tobias, Here's young Maeby's blouse.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lindsay, And then things took a turn somehow.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Tobias, Master Bluth. I haven't seen you in a week's time.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Actually, you tried to put a banger in my mouth this morning."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Tobias," Oh, was it this morn- Well, I'm sorry. I'm just so exhausted."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, So I'm just gonna talk to my son. I'm gonna tell him that I'm against this. I don't like her.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lindsay," You know, maybe if you stop judging her, he'd trust you. Look, if you say no, you're just gonna drive him right to her."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael," Hey, Dad, can you drive me to Ann's?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Nnnn... Y-Y-Y-Y-Yes.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael, Great. I'll wait in the car.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, I don't think that worked.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," Meanwhile, G.O.B. went to check on the one friend who didn't mind having him around."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George, (As Franklin.) Get your loser hand out of my ass. Or something.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," Oh, Dad, I thought... Dad? This is where you've been hi...? Michael."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George, I just came back because of your mother. She's with my brother on my anniversary. But I got an idea from George Michael. I need to re-commit myself to your mother.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B., Her?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George, You got to get me into that party. Then you got to take me to this church. I found this brochure that Ann left behind.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," That's going to be tough; I'm not really all that ""invited."""
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George," I got it all worked out, but I need a limousine."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," I-I can do this, Dad. I'm going to make you proud."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George, Never too late to start.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," And Michael drove to Ann's house, where he finally got to meet Ann's parents."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Ann," This is my father, Pastor Terry Veal."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Hello. Oh, Pastor? I, uh, I didn't, I didn't know. You didn't tell me."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael, I told you.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," No, you didn't."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Pastor Veal, People treat you so differently when they find out you're a man of God.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Oh, believe me, I know."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Pastor Veal," Oh, are you a churchgoing man?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, I am. Sometimes. Yes. I don't go religiously.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," I mean, I'm not a, I'm not a nut about it. Because there is no such thing as a nut when it comes to religion, Pastor."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Pastor Veal," Oh, I've met a few."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Well, I'm sure if you look a little bit closer, you'll find some very earnest people that are just doing their best."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael," What are you doing, Dad?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, I'm not sure. Why don't you two kids run along and let us get to know each other a little bit better? Thank you.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Pastor Veal, Maybe I should get my wife. Honey. This is George Michael's father.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, This is your wife? I didn't realize you could remarry.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Pastor Veal, What?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Is this Ann's mother?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal, I'm Mrs. Veal.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Sorry, I just... I did not expect somebody so young."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal," Next, you're going to say how Ann and I could be sisters."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," No. I'd never say that. So, listen, I'm here because I think that my son might be planning on asking your daughter to get pre-engaged."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Pastor Veal," Oh, my gosh!"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal, My gosh!
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Pastor Veal," Well, that is something to celebrate."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Pastor Veal, (Chuckling.) Can we open up some sparkling apple cider?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, No.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Pastor Veal," Oh, did you want us to go down to the liquor store and get you some liquor?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Well, don't you think they're a bit too young?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Pastor Veal," Oh, we got serious around his age."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Well, who could blame you? You got to lock that down."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, But I'm not quite sure that they're ready.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Pastor Veal," Michael, in my experience, there is no recipe for a perfect match. It takes the love of two families."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Well, you haven't met my family."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator, And that's when Michael devised a new plan to win the Veals' disapproval.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, You haven't met my family. You should meet my family. We're going to be having an anniversary party.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Pastor Veal, What a wonderful surprise! We would love to witness a celebration of their love.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, That would be a wonderful surprise.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator, But he did want a little bit of insurance.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Hey, G.O.B. Mom wants Franklin at the party. Yeah. What? No, no, no, I don't want to talk... Hey, Franklin."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator, Lucille was setting up for the anniversary party that she didn't expect her husband to attend.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille, Where's the food?!
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Featherbottom, Sorry. Just stuffing the mushroom.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lindsay," You realize that's Tobias, don't you?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille," If he's going to raid my closet, he's going to work for it."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, What happened to his ankle?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator, Tobias had attempted an entrance that he hoped would enchant his daughter.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar, Maybe you can point out to your mother that your father hasn't arrived yet.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Buster, So... my father's not here.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar, Maybe he is.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael," Ann just called. They had a pre-dawn mass. Then they were going to mass, so..."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Ann's got a great deal of mass.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Anyway, I hope that the Veals like us. Why don't you go top off your Gangee?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lindsay, Wait a minute. You invited the Veals?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Only so that they'll disapprove of us. I got to kill this pre-engagement somehow, and after Mom's second vodka and after Buster's second juice box, they're going to forbid Ann from even seeing my son, much less taking his ring, and I'm still the good guy."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lindsay," So, the devout religious family- they're the bad guys?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, You'll understand when Maeby starts getting proposals.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," Actually, Maeby had given two that day."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Executive," I'm sorry, I can't read what you wrote on this buck slip. You got the handwriting of a 15-year-old."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Maeby," ""15-year-old."" Marry me!"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Jeff The Reader," Hey, I'm almost done with that coverage. I can bring it out to you tonight. Are you still at the Balboa Towers?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator, Maeby had used her grandmother's address so as to not arouse suspicion at home. This required convincing the guard she was several years younger than her age.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mario," Boy, you get a lot of mail from that movie studio."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Maeby, I write a lot of letters to movie stars.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mario, You seem a little old for that.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Maeby, Baby-sit me!
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Jeff The Reader, That place seems so old for you.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Maeby," I'll send Dr. Epstein your compliments. And may I add, ""marry me""?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Jeff The Reader, Okay.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator, And Maeby realized she might be in need of a new deflection.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Hi, Mrs. Veal. Welcome. Mom, this is Ann's mother."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille, Are you sure this isn't her sister?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal, What a lovely thing to say.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, That's an awful thing to say. Please.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal, I'm so eager to meet your husband.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Dad escaped from prison. Did you not know that?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," In fact, George Sr. had just been picked up by his son."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," Oh, great. It's stuck. All right, just stay down and let me handle this."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mario, Is that Mr. Bluth there?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," He's got us, Dad. Come on out."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George," He's talking to you, you idiot. Cover."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Franklin," I ain't yo daddy! How's it going, brother?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mario," You want to pop the trunk and roll the windows down, please? I'm just messing with you. Hey, Franklin. How you doing, little man?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal, So I'm afraid Ann's with my husband. He had a last-minute vow renewal at the chapel.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," A call that was made by George, Sr."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," So how do we get her to the church? Tell her you're in here? Or..., no, cover her eyes and take her to the limo."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George," No, you bring her in here, knock her out with this ether and you stuff her into this garment bag. Anyone sees, you do the same. Oh, hi, Tobias."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Featherbottom," Oh... / Whenever I get a wee bit scared, I hum a little tune / / Hum, diddle-diddly, hum, dee doo... /"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George," You put a handkerchief over her mouth for a couple of seconds. No more than two, though, 'cause you could kill her."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B., I don't have a handkerchief.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George," Fine. Put the ether on the puppet's lips, have the puppet kiss her."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Franklin, I ain't kissing that old bitch.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George," (Strangling Franklin.) That's my wife, you bastard!"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," Dad, that's my wrist!"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Franklin," Hey, man, that's his neck!"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Hey, G.O.B.! Mrs. Veal, this is my brother G.O.B. Where's your pal Franklin?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B., Throat's a little sore. And wrist.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B., Nice to meet you.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal, What a lovely family.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Does it seem that way? Where's Buster? He should help.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael," You know, it's really great you did this. I-I thought you didn't really even like Ann, but you know, since you do, I thought I could get your opinion. I was thinking of giving her, like, a-a pre-engagement..."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Ring?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael, Yeah.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Wow, that catches me off guard, George Michael. I'm not sure about that. I just... I don't know if it's... I think... I think it's going to backfire on you. I think that it could backfire on you because it's going to seem like you're taking marriage, uh, lightly, you know, and you can't. It's very sacred. Sacred. Yeah. That's it."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael," All right, well, yeah. You know, I guess it did kind of feel right to me, but, yeah, if you... I've got to trust you, right?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Thank you, thank you."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael," Yeah. Hey, maybe I should... maybe I should ask if she wants to get pre-pre-engaged. Add another..."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," The mere fact that you're laughing about marriage means that you're not ready, okay?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael, What?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator, And Lucille was asked to the kitchen.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille, What's so important that you're dragging me away from this miserable party?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," Well, I just had an old friend who wanted to tell you... (As Franklin.) how much I miss you!"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille," Oh, who let this little black [bleep]…"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Buster," Hey, brother."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Franklin," Who you calling ""brother,"" you hook-ass..."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Buster, Mother!
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George, What the hell kind of puppet does Buster have on his hand?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," Just let me think. God, Franklin, your breath... Oh, God."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lindsay," So, I'm really getting excited about your proposal."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael," Oh, yeah, I'm not going to do it now."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lindsay," Because Ann's mom doesn't approve our family? Oh, come on, that was just some stupid plan your father was trying."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael, Plan? What plan?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Well, it's off. Sorry. I know that you were excited about it, but, uh, you know, in the secular world... I feel like they're a bit young."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal," You know, I... I didn't want to say anything in front of Terry, but I agree. I mean, perhaps there's someone else they're meant to meet."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Well, let's-let's just say that-that in the secular world, one finds oneself with their fair share of temptations. Not that anyone would ever act on... Oh, no, no. Stop."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal, Take me.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Mrs. Veal...
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal, Take me to your secular world.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Hey, hey, listen..."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael," You know what? I can't believe my dad. First, he's saying I need to respect the sanctity of marriage, and then, he's making out with her on the balcony."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lindsay, I thought he didn't even like Ann.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael," No, no. Mrs. Veal. Know what else he's not gonna like? I am getting pre-engaged."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lindsay," God, that's so romantic."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael, To hell with him.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lindsay," Take it. Take the sacred ring. No, not the snake. That doesn't come off."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator, Michael had just been kissed by the mother of his son's girlfriend.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal," Oh, my God!"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Don't do this. Don't do this.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal, I can't believe we're making love.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, What are you talking about? We're not making love.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal, I want to please you secularly.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, We're not going to do this.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal, But you kept telling me how beautiful I was.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Yeah, I was... surprised, because of Ann. Well..."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal, Why because of Ann?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Because of... an old wives' tale.

2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Featherbottom," Jolly news, governor. Young Master's proposing."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, George Michael? I told him not to. He said he wouldn't.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Featherbottom," Well, this was before he saw you pounding that sweet piece of Veal."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, He saw that? Where is he?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Featherbottom," Oh, he left with Lady Lindsay..."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Tobias, where are they?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Featherbottom, It is me. It's Tobias.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar, (Shrieking.) What happened?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, What's going on?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Buster," G.O.B. made me kiss Franklin, and I think my father was here."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar, Maybe he still is.

2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," What do you mean, he was here?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Buster, I think he was dragging my mother out with G.O.B.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar," Oh, you shut up."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Maeby, What's going on?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," We're trying to figure that out. Apparently, Pop-Pop kidnapped Gangee. And I have no idea where George-Michael is, or Lindsay."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Maeby, I just saw them drive off. They're going to go look for Bland.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Maeby, Who's the hottie?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, This is Ann's mother.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Maeby, Her? Does she look old enough to play Topher Grace's mom?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Where did you say Ann was?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal, At the chapel.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Yeah, we got to get down there. My son's going to pre-propose to your daughter."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," Fortunately, Tobias had rented a car to maintain his ruse."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Featherbottom, I had this shipped over from Blackstool. It's what I used to drive the Roger Moores about in.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," And Lucille awoke, half in the bag."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille, What am I doing in a Nordstrom bag?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George, It's me. I-I'm taking you to renew our vows. But first...
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," Uh, Dad..."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George, we make love.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," That partition doesn't go all the way up, remember?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille, No. No. After your vows. I want to know you won't run out on me again. I need to know you're in it for keeps.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George, Just let me see 'em.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,G.O.B.," Seriously, Dad, the radio doesn't work, either."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George, Come on. Show 'em to me.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille, George!

2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator, Buster was talking to the police when Oscar found a clue.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar, I found this! They must be going to this church. He's going to renew his vows. He's my twin brother. I know how he thinks.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Buster, They're at the Church of the Good Shepherd.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," And at the chapel, Pastor Veal was officiating."

2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael," Ann, I-I have something to ask you. Well, I-I really like you. I guess what I-I want to ask you is, will you one day, uh, intend to marry me? And it would be great to hear back on this before the real hard A.P. stuff kicks in, you know?"
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Ann, Let's do it... now. Let's actually get married.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael, Right now?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Ann, My father's right in there. He can do it as soon as he finishes.

2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator, And Michael showed up at the chapel.

2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George," Uh, faster, Pastor."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar, Stop this! Stop this now!
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," Oscar charged at George Sr., finally willing to fight for Lucille. But they did think alike and neither could land a blow."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Ann," Dad, do us. We're ready to get married."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," George Michael, don't do this just to get back at me. What you saw on the balcony, uh, Mrs. Veal started kissing me."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," This part of it was news to George Michael. Unfortunately, it was also news to Pastor Veal."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Pastor Veal, You kissed my wife?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, No. She started kissing me. You really should lock that down.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," And Pastor Veal, too, was ready to fight for the woman he loved."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Pastor Veal, (Yells)
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Buster, Ah. Finally. Where have you been?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator, The police had been delayed when they thought they'd cornered a kidnapping suspect.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Policemen #1," Put your hands up, or we'll take that as a sign of aggression against us."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Policemen #2, They're not up! He's aggressive!
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Voice, Got a little hot out there.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Buster," Well, it's getting pretty hot in here."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar, No. She's mine.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael," Oscar, I don't want her. I don't want either of them."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar, Oh. Sorry. Where's my brother?

2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Tobias," Oh, no. My wig seems to have run off."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Narrator," On George Sr., as it turned out."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Policemen #1, Who is this guy?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lindsay, This guy is my husband.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Mrs. Veal," Terry, I don't know what happened. I fell under the spell of that horrible secular family. Forgive me."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Could've used that horrible family stuff about a halfhour ago.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar, I hope you notice I didn't run.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille, You fought for me.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Oscar, What I meant to say is I-I think I broke my ankle.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille, Let's alternate hot and cool on that.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Guess the wedding's off?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael," Yeah. That's okay, Dad. You know we were talking, and we think that we were doin' it for the wrong reasons."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Yeah? You have so much to experience before you make a commitment you're not ready for. You need to get to know each other better and then you can be comfortable going all the way with it.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael, Do you mean it?
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Yes. This time I'm being honest with you.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,George Michael," Thanks, Dad."
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Michael, Okay.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Ann," It sounds like your father just gave us permission to start doing it. You must teach me, George Michael. You must teach me the ways of the secular flesh."

2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Lucille, They're not going to let you in at the country club with that.
2,Meat the Veals,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Meat_the_Veals,Buster," (As Franklin) I don't want no part of your tight-ass country-club, you freak bitch!"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," Michael Bluth had set up a meeting with Cal Cullen, owner of one of the largest parcels of land in Orange County."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Well, I hope that I can prove to you that we have a very impressive company."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Cal Cullen," Well, your family did not come off well on last night's ""Scandalmakers""."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," ""Scandalmakers"" was a show that reenacted headline-grabbing stories. The latest was about the Bluth family, the rights of which had been signed away by Tobias, in exchange for the part of George, Sr."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Scandalmakers Narrator," When allegations surfaced that he'd illegally built homes in Iraq, George Bluth Sr., assisted by his secretary, Kitty, escaped the country..."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," Due to poor acting, the burden of the story was placed on the narrator."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Scandalmakers Narrator, ...only to be found hiding under one of the homes that he himself built.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," He was actually found in a hole near the house, but this inattention to detail was typical of the laziness the show's narrator was known for."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Tobias," (As George, Sr.) I cannot survive under the house. Perhaps an attic shall I seek."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, Real shoddy narrating. Just pure crap.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," But we're back on track, and we are scandal free."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, Hey! You start the meeting without me?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Mother, uh, this is Cal Cullen. You remember my mother, Lucille. We're right in the middle of talking about this exciting giveaway spa package to entice buyers."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille," You know, he's never taken me anywhere. Oh, no, we have to live ""high and dry."""
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Cal Cullen," Well, you're certainly not dry. Michael, I'm not a prude, but it's 1 in the afternoon. Is your mother drunk?"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, I'd have to get up pretty early to get drunk by 1 o'clock.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," As it turns out, she had gotten up early and had taken pain medication because of a hangover-related headache. However, she mistook the ""drowsy eye"" alcohol warning for a ""winking-eye"" alcohol suggestion. Fortunately, she had the good sense not to drive herself to the meeting."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, No. I'll call for a car.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," Unfortunately, this was after a failed attempt to do so."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, (Sighs.) Who the hell put...?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Cal Cullen," Michael, I'm sorry. I cannot do business with you. I mean, I couldn't afford to end up on Scandalmakers."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille," Oh, you could afford to do anything you want."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille," You're just a big chicken. Uh-coodle-doodle-doo... uh-coodle-doodle-doo, uh-coodle-doodle-doo... uh-coo..."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, Michael realized that it might be time to deal with his mother's apparent problem.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Okay, that seems as good a place as any to end the meeting."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lindsay," No, I am not doing another intervention with her. Last time I felt terrible for a week."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, One year earlier the family had tried an intervention.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, Are you pouring a drink? What are you doing?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., What if she's mad?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lindsay, Good point.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Tobias, Perhaps I'll have a little sip of something.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Guys, what could she do to us? Do we have anything single malt?"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, And although the intervention didn't work...
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, We think you have a prollen.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., You're a mesh...
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, ... it turned into one of the Bluth family's better parties.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Buster, (Laughing.)
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Well, maybe an intervention is the wrong approach. What about rehab? She was just a mess at the meeting. Where were you, by the way? Yeah, I could've used your help with Mom."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., I believe I told you I was gonna be out for the holidays. It's spring break. Not that I can enjoy it. My reputation has been ruined by that jerk Phillip Litt who put my one magic show flub on his DVD.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," G.O.B. had performed a magic act at an earlier spring break to get exposure on the best-selling video series ""Girls With Low Self-Esteem."""
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," ...or two flubs, or whatever."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," There were seven flubs, and after the show, he signed a release."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," Now, you're not going to use the time that I screwed up, right?"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Phillip Litt," That wasn't part of the act? Oh, come on, man. I'd never do anything to embarrass you. Please..."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," Oh... Uh, you don't know a good bird hospital, do you?"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Phillip Litt," You're getting all this, right?"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Tobias," Well, at least the Orange County Register didn't say of your performance, ""if this is who George, Sr. is, let's hope he remains missing."" Meanwhile, they loved Dave Attell's ""risky choice"" of wearing cutoffs while portraying me."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," In fact, Mr. Attell was portraying Tobias' actual ""never-nude"" affliction. But this perplexed the Scandalmakers audience, due to the unfocused nature of the narrator's explanation."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," No, I think mine's worse. You should have seen what happened to me on the boardwalk today. They were laughing at me. Me!"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, (Chuckling.)
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lindsay, (Laughs.) Those tapes are awful. Women tricked into taking their tops off. I have a daughter I don't want corrupted by the media.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," Unbeknownst to Lindsay, Maeby was a fairly prominent member of the media as she had secretly conned her way into a job as a film executive."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Mort Meyers, This Young Man on the Beach script sucks. She goes with a guy just because he says she's awesome? You call that dialogue?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Maeby," Hey, I didn't write it."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Mort Meyers," No, but you're gonna fix it. It's a spring break movie. Get down there and find out what they sound like."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Maeby," Oh, yeah, right. Do you really think I look college-aged?"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Mort Meyers, I'm not drunk. But I'm willing to be. Hint.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Maeby," Oh, Mort. You're going to be so easy to blackmail. Hint."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lindsay, This pig Phillip Litt is out there asking girls to take their tops off. It's an outrage.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," Well, of course you feel that way. You're jealous. You're a surfboard. But, I do agree, he is a pig... Hey, what the hell was that for?"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Can we stop worrying about Girls with Low Self-Esteem, and start focusing on sobering up the woman who gave us ours? No, seriously what do you think about rehab?"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Tobias," Well, she won't go willingly, I can tell you that."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., May I make a suggestion? Get implants. Really.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," What...?! Come on, this stuff is expensive."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, And so Michael set out to convince his mother that she needed help.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, Hello? Hello? I have a surprise for you.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, Did I win the prize?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, You won the prize!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, I won the prize! I won the prize!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, Hmm...
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, For what?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," We were going to give one employee a week at the spa. We were even going to put them in the ad. But then I thought, ""What about Mom? She's elegant, she deserves it."" I was going to tell you at the office, but then I thought ""No... if I bring her around now, she might vomit on the overhead projector. Let's just wait until she's crawling around on her own."""
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, I'm so embarrassed about that. I don't think I was supposed to drink with my medication.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," Actually, it wasn't even her medication."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille," Of course, I can't take Oscar to an elegant place. His only remaining pair of pants blew apart the other day."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, I was thinking that I would go with you for the week.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, Oh...
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Buster," So, what, I just stay here alone? I'm not exactly equipped to run this place by myself. You can't just leave me here alone!"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Buster, Have a great trip.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, But it wouldn't turn out to be a great trip at all.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Clerk," Hello, welcome to Shady Pines Rehab."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, Hello. Checking in.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, Rehab?! This isn't a spa?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," No, Mom!"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, This isn't a spa!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Voices, Get her! Get her!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, Ma!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Voices, We got a runner. Let's go. Get some men out.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," As Michael's mother was being held against her will, George, Sr. was about to be confronted with a similar problem."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George, Kitty? How did you find me?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Kitty," I thought you were dead, until I saw Scandalmakers. They got so much wrong, but something about your son-in-law's comment, ""perhaps an attic shall I seek,"" had the ring of truth to it."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, Notice it wasn't something the narrator said.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Kitty, You abandoned me in Mexico.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George," Kitty, honey, I-I know you're mad."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Kitty," Stop talking, George! You stop talking! I am in charge now. You're coming with me."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George," No, I can't. I can't. I have... I have a life here. There are people who-who depend on me."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Kitty, Fine. But I can't make any promises about what happens to that cooler of evidence I have.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George, If I could... just have a moment to say good-bye...
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," Meanwhile, at the banana stand, Maeby was hoping to find some witty banter with which to authenticate her feature film."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,College Kid #1, I want the hot chick to serve me.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Maeby, What other words would you use to describe me?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George Michael," Um, she's 15. And she's my cousin."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George Michael," So, you can't touch your cousin- my cousin. You can't... You know, you don't have to stick around. I could just work late tonight. It doesn't matter, 'cause, you know, my girlfriend Ann, she's out of town. Which is actually kind of lucky in the end, 'cause all these guys would be coming on to her."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Maeby," Yeah, you really dodged a bullet there."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," Nearby, Phillip Litt was making his latest video."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Phillip Litt," Okay, everybody, gather around, gather around. Ladies, here's the deal. We have hats. You have breasts. You show your breasts, you get a hat, okay? So, if anybody wants to get back at daddy... now's the time. Whoo! Wait. Cut, cut, cut. We've got a surfboard in the shot."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Crew Member," Surfboard, stop tape."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lindsay, We're here to stop you from taking advantage of these girls.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Phillip Litt," You know what? You're sassy, you're sexy. You speak your mind. There's nothing hotter. Give her a hat, Barry."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lindsay, I don't want a hat. I want you to leave these women alone.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Phillip Litt," I'm giving them a chance to be idolized, which is an opportunity these women are never gonna have again."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Eileen, I want to be idolized!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Phillip Litt," Yeah, you do!"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lindsay, Eileen! Stop it! You've got nothing to gain from that!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Eileen, That's easy for you to say. You already have a hat.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Phillip Litt," Come on, girls!"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lindsay, This is no way to get your daddies to notice you!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," Nearby, Lindsay's own father failed to notice her, as he was being taken to a local motel where he refused Kitty's sexual advances."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Kitty," You promised me power and a child, and I have neither. I'm going to take care of this problem on my own."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George, You never promise crazy a baby...
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," George, Sr. was abandoned, and longed for Lucille. And Buster felt the same way."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Buster, Whoo-hoo-hoo!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," Restless, Buster went to the kitchen to find something to help him sleep, when he came across Lucille's emergency stash of wine, which he mistook for a giant juice box."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Buster, (Singing.) / Mama's moving on / Mama's all alone... /
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, It was the first taste of alcohol Buster had since he was nursing.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Buster, Mama!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," And Michael, his mother no longer a threat, met again with Cal Cullen."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Thank you so much for your understanding, sir, and as I mentioned on the phone, she did seek help."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, (Yells.)
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," And it was extremely moving when she finally admitted that she has a problem. They'll take good care of you here at Shady Pines, Mom."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille," I'll take good care of you, you son of a...!"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Cal Cullen," Shady Pines is a wonderful facility. Up there on the hill. You know, they used to film Sugarfoot up there."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, No!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Cal Cullen, Were you a fan of Sugarfoot?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, I loved it.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, Sugarfoot had been off the air 12 years before Michael was born.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Cal Cullen," Well, sing the theme song of Sugarfoot along with me. (Singing.) / Sugarfoot /"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Uh... Yeah, / Sugarfoot /"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Cal Cullen, / Sugarfoot /
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, Yes.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Cal Cullen, / Easy lopin' / Cattle ropin' Sugarfoot /
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, (Humming.)
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Cal Cullen, / Carefree as the tumbleweeds... /
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, Huchah!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Cal Cullen," Oh, what the hell? You're a good kid. Let's make the deal."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Oh, great. I've got paperwork..."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Kitty, Michael! Remember me? Perhaps this will jog your memory.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, Let's...
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Cal Cullen," Oh, they're crooked."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Kitty," I've kidnapped your father, Michael, and I have a cooler full of evidence that will bring down this corrupt company. Unless your mother meets me today at 4 at Señor Tadpole's. Spring break. Whoo!"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, Dad?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, Michael's dad had just been kidnapped...
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, ... and then he received a call that his brother had been found drunk.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Buster," No, I'm fine. I'm telling you. For the first time, I realize that maybe I'm better off without her."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Yeah, well, we've got to bring her back."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Buster," Oh, thank God."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," So if we want to get that evidence back, and Dad, Kitty is insisting on a meeting with Mom."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lindsay, What can Mom do for her?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," I don't know. I just... I gotta get my hands on that evidence. The problem is, I just checked her in to rehab. They're not exactly going to let me check her out and take her to a bar."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," So, G.O.B., I need you to help me sneak her past the guards."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," Well, gee, I didn't think the woman I'd be checking out at spring break would be Mom."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Buster, She's better looking than the whores you date.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," Don't call my escorts ""whores."""
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Buster, Mom's still got it!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., I don't date whores!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lindsay," Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, It's just Mom and whores.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lindsay," No, how would you like it? Actually, that's not a bad idea. I should turn the tables on men and see how they like being objectified. Men with low self-esteem. Get their clothes off."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Tobias, That is a great... (Grunts.) That is a great social statement. I shall get the video camera. This is ripe for parody. This is ripe.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Buster, He just wants to see boys' Linuses.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Buster," Oh, go..."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, Here we go.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, And so Michael went back to see his mom.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," I-I know that you're upset with me because I brought you here under false pretenses, but I really was worried about you."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille," Oh, please. I've been drinking since before you were born. So if alcohol's the reason I'm here, I got news for you, bub, it's the only reason you're here, too."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Hey, you're mean sober, too."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Uh, listen, I need your help. Kitty has shown up, and she got ahold of Dad."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, She found him in the attic? They had a rerun of Scandalmakers last night. Everybody figured it out.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, She would like to meet you at a bar. She says she's got some evidence that could bring the business down if you don't go.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, You're sending me into a bar? Are you sure you can trust me to make decisions for myself?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," I just need you to find out what she wants, okay, while I check all the local motels for Dad."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, All right but here's what I want. A spa weekend with you-a real one. I want to spend spring break with you.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," You have high self-esteem, right?"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, Not after being in here. It's a nightmare.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., Michael. Mom. We've got to go now. I created a diversion.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., I'd like to check my uncle in for rehab.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Oscar, I thought we were buying pants.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., Of course you think that- you're high as a kite. He needs help. He needs help. He needs help.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Oscar, (Moaning.)
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, And so Lucille was able to meet with Kitty at Señor Tadpole's.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Kitty, I want what's due to me-- a Bluth son. And I know you have the material.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, Kitty was right.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," Ten years earlier, George, Sr. was taking an experimental hair growth drug. Fearing damage to his fertility, he froze a specimen of his reproductive material in case he ever wanted another child."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," Soon, news came out that the drug, although somewhat successful, wreaked havoc on the central nervous system."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille," So what do you need me for? He's not taking the monkey drug anymore. And you're the one who's got him, not me."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Kitty," Oh, you know why. He won't touch me. He said he doesn't cheat on his wife anymore."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, He said that?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Voices, (Yelling.) Drinking contest!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, Tell you what. I'll drink you for it.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Kitty, I heard you don't handle your booze so well anymore.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, So this should be easy for you. That one didn't count.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, And Michael met up with G.O.B. to try and find their father.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., I got it. From the banana stand freezer. The exact same kind of cooler that's in the photo with Dad.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, What do we need another cooler for?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," Oh, poor Michael. You do not think like a magician. Such a ""How dey do dat."""
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, Uh-huh.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," It's a classic bait and switch. This is a decoy cooler. We take it in, switch it with the one from the photo and get out of there. Kitty comes back, everything's normal. It's like we were never there."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, But Dad's gone.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," Long gone. But it buys us all the time in the world. I got it back, Mikey, the self-confidence. I am a magician."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," No, I'm saying, when Kitty comes back and notices that Dad's gone, the first thing she's going to do is check the cooler to see if the evidence is there. It buys us, like, one second."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., I'm a worthless magician.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, Not true.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," No, I can't even do one simple trick."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Now come on, now, please."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., I'm covered with sweat.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Don't say that about yourself. Look at me. It's a great trick. Would've been flawless if you had a decoy Dad, too."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," Damn it, and I used a guy who looked just like him in my last bait and switch."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Oscar, Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," Well, I'm no longer needed here."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," No, no, no. I think the cooler's actually going to help us. The extra second that it buys us could be the difference."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., Great. Just give me a couple minutes to catch my breath.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," Lucille, minutes out of rehab, was engaging in a drinking contest at the behest of her son."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille," Just let me know when you're ready, dear."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Voices, (Yelling.) She's mixing!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, While right outside the bar...
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Maeby," I know what the shape of a banana reminds you of, and I know that when I say ""nuts"" it makes you giggle..."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,College Kid #4, (Giggles.)
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Maeby," ... but do you have any other response to ""Here's a banana with nuts?"""
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,College Kid #4, (Whoops loudly.)
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Maeby, Why are we even going after this idiot demographic?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George Michael," Maeby, don't you get it? They're not even eating these. They just like saying ""bananas"" and ""nuts,"" and I won't... I won't tell you why. That's your father's job."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Tobias," Come on. Let's see some bananas and nuts. Oh, perhaps we should just pull their pants off."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Phillip Litt, Hey. What the hell do you think you're doing? This is where we shoot.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lindsay," Yeah, well, you've got competition now, 'cause we're making our own video."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Phillip Litt," Will you just get over it. It's nudity. Just because you're ashamed of your body, doesn't mean everyone should be."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Tobias," Oh, really? Well, let's see how you feel about what you're packing."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lindsay, (Gasps.) You're a bleeping never-nude?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lindsay, You're asking girls to take their tops off and you can't even be naked? I've got to get this.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Tobias," Lindsay, I've already got it. I'm back in the cut-offs. Lindsay..."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Phillip Litt, I didn't see you at the convention.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Tobias," No, I was in Germany. I teleconferenced in."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Phillip Litt, Oh. Did you got to the seminar on chafing?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Tobias," Dr. Schoenweiss, yes."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," This is never going to work. There's too many people, too many rooms."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," Michael, we can't give up. This is important. Believe me, I'd rather be down at the beach, having drinks, howling at chicks. (Howls.)"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George, (Howls.)
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., Dad?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George," Oh, my boys. Yes, you came. You came for me."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Yeah, hi, Dad. G.O.B.'s going to get you out of those handcuffs. Can you do it, pal?"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., One handcuff key coming up.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, Great.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., (Gags.) (Burps.) (Retches.)
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George, What the hell are you doing?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., I swallowed a key just in case I ended up doing a show.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., (Gagging.)
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George, Come on. This is disgusting.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., I'm doing this for you.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," This continued for some time, while Michael switched out the coolers."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George, I don't understand. Why you're switching out the coolers?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," It buys us time, Dad."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George," What, like a second?"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Don't worry about it, okay? I will tell you this- when I get this evidence out of here, I'm turning it right into the court."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George, Are you kidding? I don't care if the evidence gets out there. It gets me off the hook.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," What are you saying, this exonerates you?"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George, I told you before I was a patsy. I was set up. I am tired of looking guilty.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Well, that's... that's great."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., (Gags.)
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., Now who's a horrible magician?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George," That is a crown, you horse's ass."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Maeby, And how does that make you feel?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,College Kid #2, Awesome.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," And George Michael caught up with Maeby, determined to save her self-esteem."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George Michael," Look, I don't want to ruin your fun, you know? But I hate to see guys treat you like this. You're better than that. To me, anyway. You're-you're..."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Maeby, Awesome?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George Michael," No, I was going to say you're like this flower. And I know it's springtime, but I hate to see you get plucked by someone who doesn't even care that you're blossoming."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Maeby, That's what I've been waiting to hear.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," Maeby was referring to the dialogue, but George Michael had just rediscovered his feelings for his cousin."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,George Michael," (On phone.) Hi, Ann. It's George Michael Bluth. Um, when you get back into town, we should talk."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Waiter #5," Can I get you anything else, ma'am?"
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille," No, thanks, I have to get back to rehab."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Voices, (Yells.) She's in rehab!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," And so George, Sr. was free and Michael and G.O.B. absconded with the evidence."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," Just one heck of a trick you ended up pulling in there, G.O.B."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," Truthfully, that wasn't part of the act. I was actually trying to get the key to come out of my mouth."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael," That part was very surprising, but I'm talking about how you helped me get Dad out of there at all. Thanks to you, this family could end up being okay."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, And G.O.B. had finally overcome his own low self-esteem.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,College Kid #3, Hey. Aren't you that magician who always embarrasses himself?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B., Not anymore. Not anymore.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, G.O.B.!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, But he lost it along with the exonerating evidence.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, Here let me get it.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,G.O.B.," They're laughing, Michael. They're laughing."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, And that's how you narrate a story.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, Lucille gets some disturbing information..."
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, Did you get the evidence?
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, Yes. And then G.O.B. ruined it. After all the trouble that we went through to switch out the cooler with the one from the banana stand.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, The one in the freezer? I was storing very important things there.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Narrator, ... and Kitty finds what she's been looking for.
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Lucille, There was 250cc's of your father in that banana stand!
2,Spring Breakout,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Spring_Breakout,Michael, (Strained.) No touching.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, Michael Bluth was working at home when he noticed something unusual.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, That can't be good.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, It's a model house.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Dave Williams," Well, the drain pipes aren't hooked up. They just empty under the house. Plus, there's a whole lot of blue paint down there."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, And pieces of denim?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Dave Williams, Yeah.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, We've got a guy like that here.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Dave Williams," Well, that's why your living room is sinking. I think the city's going to have to red-tag it."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, The city is sending out an inspector. They're going to be crawling over every inch of this place. You're going to need to leave.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George," Well, where the hell do you want me to go, Michael? Back to your mother's? I believe there's a freeloading loser in my bed."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," You know, Buster lost a hand, Dad. He's going through a lot."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George, I'm talking about Oscar.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Oh, yes, your brother. I could see why that would bug you."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," In fact, Oscar had stayed with Lucille primarily to reconnect with Buster, whom he secretly believed to be his natural son."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Buster," Hey, Uncle. I feel so responsible for that."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, Oscar had gotten injured on a shoddy device George had invented when he forgot that Buster was wearing a prosthetic hand.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Buster, (Screaming.)
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Oscar, (Screaming.)
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Buster, I'm sorry! It's my father's fault.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Oscar," My fault? I was trying to keep you from burning yourself, you idiot! I mean, yes, yes. George sure rushed this to market."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George, The only reason she likes him is he has hair. And the only reason he has any is because he's never had any stress.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Yeah, well, you could save me a lot of stress if you just turned yourself in."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George," No, never. I can't go back to the joint. No, I can not... go back there. It's a hellhole."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Dad, we finally got the court to try you in absentia. Which means we're not supposed to have any idea where you are. So you don't have to go to prison, but you can't stay here."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Maeby," Hey, do you remember that French movie we tried to sneak into once? You know, Dangerous Cousins?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael," No, I... Why, did we...? Why... I don't... I don't remember that."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," George Michael remembered very well. In fact, he currently had a copy of the DVD hidden in his sock drawer."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael, Kind of. Why do you ask?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Maeby," Well, I got passes to the premiere of the American remake. It's supposed to be great."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," It wasn't great, and Maeby knew it. The studio at which she had finagled the job had hoped to avoid controversy by artlessly explaining that the two leads weren't biological cousins."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Female Voice In Movie, Shut up and kiss me!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Maeby, Where is everybody?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Mort Meyers," They've been fired. And you've got to fix this, or you're going to be fired, too. Cut it down if you have to."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Maeby, But it's only 71 minutes long.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," And later at the office, Michael had another surprise."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, This can't be good.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias, Michael... it saddens me greatly to say to you that I can no longer work at the Bluth Company. You've been a great boss...
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," I'm sorry, Tobias. Do you work here?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias," Do I work...? I developed an eating disorder being your assistant, Michael."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, I've never saw you at the desk.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias," Well, excuse me if I was too busy on my knees in front of the toilet, Michael."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias, I have a tremendous opportunity now that the Blue Man Group has dropped their cease-and-desist and invited me to audition in Las Vegas. Also I've developed some issues with food...
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, I'm sorry to interrupt one more time. Is this the real Blue Man Group this time?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," Tobias had recently been asked to address a group of depressed men who had been described over the phone as ""blue."""
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Leader, Tobias Fünke.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias, I feel like a bleeping idiot.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias, Fortunately I found a wonderful circle of men to get me through that.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias," Oh, before I forget- your old secretary Kitty Sanchez called and wanted to meet with you. I penciled her in for 4 o'clock today."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, Why didn't you tell me about this?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias," Oh, this is my fault, too?! Everything... No! No! I will not let this make me eat!"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," So get this- tomorrow I have to go on record and say I don't know where Dad is, okay? And now Kitty Sanchez wants to meet with me."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, And meetings with Kitty had never ended well.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Kitty, So say good-bye...
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," No, no, no."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Kitty, Spring break!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Kitty, Perhaps this will jog your memory.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Plus, Dad will not leave the attic, which means he's going to get caught by the inspector, which means I'm going to get caught for hiding him."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," Why don't you get G.O.B. to do your dirty work for you? Shall I knock Dad out and chain him to a pipe somewhere, or should I risk another herpes outbreak with Kitty? Which is it this time, Michael?!"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Well, definitely not those two things. But are you upset about something, G.O.B.?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," How about the fact that I made you a thank-you gift last week, about which you haven't said word one?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Come on, you asked me for $5,000 so that you could invest in a Franklin CD. Now, I assumed that you were talking about the mutual fund and not a compact disc of you singing to your hand."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, G.O.B. had recently made a recording of his ventriloquism act.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Engineer," ""Franklin Comes Alive,"" take one."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, He hoped it would break down racial barriers and maybe be a crossover hit.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," (Singing) / It ain't easy being white / (Singing, as Franklin.) / It ain't easy being brown / (Singing, as himself.) / All this pressure to be bright / (Singing, as Franklin.) / I got children all over town / (Singing, as himself.) / Sometimes... / (In normal voice.) Hey, where'd the guy go?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," I tried to express something to you in a couple of those numbers and maybe, just maybe heal this country a little bit, but you, you didn't even bother to listen to it."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," I did listen to it. I-I-I-I am listening to it. G.O.B., hey, maybe the reason I didn't say anything is because I didn't want to embarrass you, pal. It's my favorite, favorite record."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," Well, then you-you bleeped up. Because I am so embarrassed."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, (;It's a good CD. It's a really good CD.)
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., I can't believe that you love it.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, I love it so much.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," Oh, God... Oh, God, look at us. We're crying like a couple of girls."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Aw... you're the only one crying, but I loved the music."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., And the card with your face on it?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, And the healing.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," Home run! We'll do your dirty work for you, Mikey. You leave the rough stuff to Franklin and me."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, Now I gotta listen to that CD.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," Hi, Dad."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George, Right.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., You remember Franklin.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George," Hey, Franklin."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., (as Franklin) My man! How 'bout some tongue?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George, Wha-Oh
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, But Franklin didn't want to kiss at all. G.O.B. had soaked the puppet's mouth in ether.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," And downstairs, Tobias shared his good news with Lindsay."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias," ""...once in a lifetime."""
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lindsay," Tobias, I am not uprooting my life and moving to Vegas. Maybe this is a sign that our relationship isn't working, and we should split again."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias," Wait a second. I thought we were split up, and this would bring us back together."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lindsay," Well, maybe the fact that we don't know if we're together or not is a sign that we should split again."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias," Or stay split up. Okay, forget about Vegas. We'll stay here and get back together. Or stay together and either rekindle or fan this fire."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," And soon, G.O.B. was on his way to dump his father on the police station steps."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., Do you forgive me?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, And he decided to let himself off the hook using his ventriloquist skills.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," (Imitating George Sr.) I cherish you, G.O.B. Come here and give me a kiss."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," (as him) I'm driving, Dad."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., (as George Sr.) Now!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, It was weird.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, And that's when G.O.B. noticed the CD and card that he'd made for Michael.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., It's not even open. Michael!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," Meanwhile, Michael's meeting with Kitty wasn't as distressing as he'd thought."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Kitty, The program has changed my life. And I have a sponsor now. (Whispers) He's famous.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, That's great.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Kitty, I can't tell you who he is. But let's just say that he was on Night Court.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Well, you look great."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Kitty, I can tell you who it's not. It's not Bull. It's not Harry Anderson.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, I got it.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Kitty, He's white.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, I know who it is.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Kitty," I think what happens is, when I don't have a man in my life, I tend to go a little crazy."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, Mm-hmm.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Kitty, But I'm keeping it together now. And I wanted to tell you I'm not gonna try to hurt you guys anymore.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, Don't suppose I can get that in writing.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Kitty, You did try to blow me up on that boat.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, Sorry about that.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Kitty, Just don't piss me off again.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Kitty, (Cackles)
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, (Chuckling)
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias," You all right? ""Oftentimes the heart acts without consulting the head, and thusly""- Oh, I see you wasted no time in filling my seat hole."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Kitty," Oh, no, no. I just came by so that you could say good-bye to these."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Oh, no, no, no, no."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Kitty, It's the last time you're going to be seeing these.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias, How ironic. I just found out I'm staying. Will you take these back?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Okay, let's just all put our tops down. Just put 'em on down. You're not goin' to Vegas?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias," Sadly, my wife said no to my dream. So I shall continue to toil through this waking life."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Kitty," Wow, you are so real. Why can't I meet someone like you?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, And Michael decided that he better keep Kitty occupied with a man. At least until after his meeting.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Hey, gang, I got an idea. Tobias, why don't you take Kitty out for the afternoon?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, No. No setup.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias, What a great idea for a Hugh Grant-Julia Roberts type movie.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, True.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Kitty," I recently heard that the actor, John Larroquette, was looking for a meaty character piece."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," And so, free of obstacles Michael prepared to sign the affidavit maintaining he had no idea where his father was."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Wayne Jarvis, You have not been in contact with him. Are you prepared to do that?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Wayne Jarvis," Officers! Michael, these men are here -just a little bit early- because we have photographic evidence which discredits the affidavit you just signed."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Barry," Are those balls? 'Cause the last time we were here, they were balls."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Wayne Jarvis, These are not balls. This was taken with a traffic camera. It shows you in your car with your father within the last 24 hours.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Barry, I wish they were balls.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, Michael was in police custody after a photo of him helping his father escape had turned up.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Did you see that picture? That's you, right? Were you holdin' up a photo of me or somethin'?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., Of course you don't recognize it. It's the card from the CD you didn't even open.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," You found that, did you?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," Right between the gearbox and the ""pull back from aircraft"" lever. So this is how you repay me for how I repay you?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," I actually did not get a chance to listen to it yet. Probably should've told you, but I didn't want to hurt your feelings."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," Oh, you're so sensitive. Just like when you whipped up those tears talking about how much you loved it."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," I will listen to it, I promise. But I'm in a lot of trouble here. Where is Dad?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., I've got him stashed away somewhere safe now.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Get him, quickly, otherwise I'm gonna be stuck in here."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., Good! I hope you rot in here!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, What are you talking...
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., And guess what else? Dad kissed me.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, How? He looked pretty unconscious in that picture.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., I didn't say he was totally into it.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, And George Michael tried to break up with Ann.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael," I-I can't go out tomorrow night, 'cause there's this movie premiere. It's kind of racy, but..."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Ann," Oh, the cousin one. Yeah, I can't believe it. I was just going to ask you to go."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael, Really? You want to see that?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Ann," No, I want to get the whole gang from the church group together. We're going to picket those bastards."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," George Michael had only heard Ann swear once before, when he'd joined some of her youth group to protest the home of Marc Cherry, executive producer of the hit show, Desperate Housewives."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Marc Cherry, It's a satire!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Ann, He saw us! The bastard saw us!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, And the promise of another kiss was too enticing to turn down.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael," Yeah, okay. The bastards..."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," Oscar, meanwhile, checked in on Buster."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Oscar," Buster, Buster, be careful!"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Buster," Wait, wait. It's a not a real hand, remember?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Oscar," Oh, I'm so forgetful. I hope you don't get that from me."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Buster, Get that from you? Do you feel okay?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Oscar," (Yells.) Just forget it! I wanted to share my Pop Secret with you! Oh, but forget it!"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Buster, Pop secret? Is Oscar my real father?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," Lucille, meanwhile, was on the phone with Michael."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," They're keeping me overnight while I wait for my arraignment, I'd appreciate it if you could tell my son that I'm on a business trip."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lucille, Why can't the girl at work do it?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, Tobias? I sent him on a date with Kitty to keep her off our back.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lucille," Well, you better hope Lindsay doesn't find out. She'll be devastated."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lindsay, Find out what?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lucille, Your husband's dating Kitty the whore.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lindsay, He is? That's... that's horrible.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lucille, Do I know my daughter? She only wants what she can't have.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Since you're devastating people, go ahead and tell G.O.B. that I'll be telling the cops that it was him in the truck. So he'll be joining me here. I've got a nice hard cot with his name on it."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lucille, You'd do that to your own brother?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," I said ""cot."""
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Buster," You lied to me! You said my father was my father, but my uncle is my father... My father is my uncle!"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, It was at that moment that the guards played a CD they'd recently confiscated.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., (Singing as Franklin.) Now I've got a special thank you for a brother who made this happen.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, Is that Franklin?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," (Singing off key.) / Yeah, I would fight for you / I'd lie for you / Walk the wire for you / Yeah, I'd die for you /"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," And Michael realized that he could never turn his brother in. G.O.B., meanwhile, was having a similar epiphany."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," (Singing.) / I do it for you. / (Into phone.) Barry, it's G.O.B. Tell Michael not to testify. I'm bringing in Dad."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., Franklin!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," (In British accent as Franklin.) You've ruined the act, G.O.B."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, And Lucille confronted Oscar.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lucille, You told him you were his father?!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Oscar, I did no such thing.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lucille, You're high!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Oscar, You're drunk!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lucille," Not this time. I've had enough of you. So say good-bye to these, because it's the last time..."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, And Ann in a protest at the theater.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Maeby, George Michael? Are you protesting this?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael, This isn't the line?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Ann," Yes, he is protesting it. He even helped me make the signs."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael," Well, only mine and the one that says, ""This is a tricky gray area."""
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Movie Passerby, What are you guys protesting?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Ann, It's a disgusting movie about cousins who are into each other.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Movie Passerby, Are there any more seats?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Maeby, Yeah. It's the best 52 minutes you'll spend all day.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Ann," Oh, no, we're making it worse! Prepare to be swallowed into the depths of hell."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael, So I guess that means no kiss?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Ann, I'm not really in the mood for a kiss. This isn't Marc Cherry's house.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Buster, Where's your dad?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael, I don't know. I just got here.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Buster," Oh, that's right, Mother told me he went to jail. Ah! I'm so mad at her. Guess who I just found out my father is?!"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael, Jail?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Buster," Oscar! He didn't mean to tell me, but I figured it out."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael," No, I mean, my dad is in jail?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Buster," Oh, I wouldn't worry about it. Barry's very good."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Buster," Okay, I'm going upstairs and take a long shower. I don't even want to smell like Mother anymore."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael, I don't think we're supposed to shower right now.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lindsay, Tobias back yet?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael, No.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lindsay," Oh, my God, he's really out with her."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael, Are you drunk?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lindsay, you have to grab love while you have it. Don't let it get away.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Maeby," Oh, there you are. Hey, George Michael."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lindsay," Oh, Maeby, everything's fine! Your daddy's just out. Yeah, we're doing great. Mommy's going to take a bath with a bottle of wine."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael," I'm don't know if we're supposed to use the, um, the..."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Maeby," So get this. All that press actually made the premiere a hit. I mean, there's actually lines for the next show. Thanks, buddy. Hey, look at that. We didn't get swallowed up into hell."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael, My God.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," That's when George Michael finally got close to Maeby, who, by the way, might not be his biological cousin."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," Just then, however, G.O.B. came home to retrieve his father from where he'd stashed him."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., Dad's gonna be crushed!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael, You don't have to tell him!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," But G.O.B. was referring to his own father, who he had hidden under the house."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., Uh-oh.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, G.O.B. had hidden his father under a house that had just collapsed.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," Children, you're small. Crawl under there."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Maeby, I don't want to go under there.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael, We don't want to go under there.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., He's not under there. He got away. Thank God.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, But then Gob remembered that this meant Michael would have to go to prison.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., Michael
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George Michael, We
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Maeby, I
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, And Michael and Barry made their way to the arraignment.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Barry, G.O.B. is bringing your father. Everything is going to work out fine.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," I wish they'd hurry up. But I gotta tell you, I am a little torn. My father, he has created a lot of problems for the family and by staying in the attic he was insuring I would go to jail with him, but- Well, maybe I'm not so torn."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., Michael. Barry.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Hey, Gob. Where's Dad?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., Great news. Dad wasn't crushed to death.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, Was there risk of that?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," Yes. Well, I handcuffed him under the house. But he got free- the pipes I chained him to weren't connected to anything."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Barry," Oh, I'm not prepared for this case."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, Are you insane?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," No ""thank you"" for trying?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, I'm sick of you needing constant validation for screwing up. Let me tell you what's gonna happen. I'm gonna tell them it was you in the stair car.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," Well, let me tell you what's gonna happen. First, I'm gonna beat the crap out of you, then I'm gonna call an ambulance. Then knowing you, I'm gonna have to wait for some kind of an apology."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., (Grunts)
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, Come here!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, As the boys set to once again fighting in front of the courthouse
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lucille, Stop it! Stop it!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, the family began to show up for the arraignment.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias," I know you're in the middle of something, but I'm afraid I can't work for you today. I'm going to Vegas with Kitty."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, But Lindsay wasn't about to lose her man without a fight.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lindsay, Over my dead body!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lindsay," Tobias, I actually fought for you."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lindsay, Huh? (faints)
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lucille," Oh, George, I've lost you again."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Buster," Take back Oscar, Mother."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Lucille, I think I lost him too.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," In fact, Oscar was on his way out of town when he was approached by George Sr. who had just escaped from under the house."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George," I want you to turn me in so you can get the reward, take care of the family."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Oscar, Why would you do that for me?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,George, Because we're brothers.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," Later, while George was shaving his unconscious brother's head, he wondered whether there really was a reward, and if there was a way he could get it. But there was no time, and getting even with his brother was reward enough."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, So it was Oscar who was going to be spending a little time alone in prison.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Oscar," Oh, no, don't hit. I-I'm not..."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," I guess Dad finally came through for us, huh? He actually made a sacrifice. Although, who knows what he's up to, you know? We should probably just stay away from him for a little while. Let him have a little time alone in prison. He is right about one thing, though."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," We're brothers who shouldn't be fighting. We cannot afford to lose each other, okay?"
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., I can't. I already lost a brother today.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael, Franklin?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B.," Well, I didn't lose him, but he's all puckered and white."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," On the plus side, you can take him to lunch at the club now."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., That's the exact kind of joke he would have loved!
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Oh, man! Hmm."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., Oh. (Singing.) / You know it's true / / Everything I do /
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Michael," Please, don't do this."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,G.O.B., / I do it for you! /

2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Oscar," I burned them on a, uh, a Cornballer."

2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Oscar," My hair's gonna grow back, you'll see."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator," ... Tobias and Kitty go to Vegas, only to find that his dream job has been filled, ..."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Tobias, Found someone already?
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Stage Manager," Just came out of nowhere, this guy. And the great thing is, he's never out of character."
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Narrator, ... and George turns out to be right about the effects of stress.
2,Righteous Brothers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Righteous_Brothers,Oscar, What the hell's happening to me? Why won't it grow back?

3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator," But if they ever had a child, it would be. Because the girl was his cousin Maeby."

Especially the part about the cops."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator, But Pop-Pop had other plans. And Michael awoke to find his camping trip going south.

3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B., Oh.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," Well, check it. The illusion is called ""Free Bird."" A magical bird- me in a beak- stands on a platform. There's a puff of smoke, and I'm gone. Then seconds later, high above in a once-empty cage... who should appear?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lucille, A guy that kind of looks like you?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," No. That's not how I do the trick. Even it was, how'd the look-alike get up there?"

3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," No! For your information, Dad asked me to do this on the day he pleads not guilty as a spectacular protest. A protestacular. Maybe even get it on the local news."

3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Tobias, As your look-alike.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B., Right. They're going to see the ink. It's more of a leading man role. But it's not really done that way.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Tobias, Guess I shouldn't have used that permanent... marker.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, Starting to see why you want that divorce.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay," Yeah, well, actually, I've been thinking. Instead of spending money on a divorce, which can be slow... maybe I should get something faster."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, Not the car. I said no to the Volvo.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay," The Lexus. The Volvo didn't have satellite radio, which is crazy. I mean, what are we, Amish?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, I knew you wouldn't have the guts to go through with the divorce.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay, You're one to talk. You haven't had a serious relationship since your wife. And you guys weren't even speaking toward the end.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, Lot of that was the coma.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay," Yeah, I've heard your side of it."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay, You haven't had the guts to meet someone else.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lucille, Look who finally got his pants on. You've got ten minutes.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George, You got to get me out of here.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, You're the one that said no to prison.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George, I was wrong. There you just had to shut your eyes and take it. Here you have to shut your eyes and give it.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," Now, listen, we can't just go in there and plead ""not guilty,"" we have to have someone big behind us, our own private Matlock. So I made some calls and I got him."

3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," Boy, that's an awful lot of money for the stupidest idea I've ever heard."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George, The juries love him.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," That's just it, Dad. There won't be a jury because we are pleading guilty."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," I am not guil... All right, I didn't want to tell you this. Are you ready for the bombshell?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, Andy Griffith wasn't the bombshell?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George, I'm a patsy. I was set up. By the Brits.

3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George, I thought that was the guy who played the Soup Nazi.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, Come on.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," I told him how much I liked his work. Anyway, the Brits used that picture to blackmail me."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," A picture like that, Michael, can end your career."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," These are dangerous people, Michael. They'll do whatever it takes to get inside this family and just bring us down."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, British people?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," Oh, they're polite and the men all sound gay, but they will rip out your heart. And their breath..."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, And you want to go after these people?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," Well, yes, it takes a little courage, Michael. I know that's not your strongest suit. You're even scared to ask a girl out on a date."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, What? Why does everybody think that I'm scared of girls?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, What are you doing?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lucille, Michael and women?! A-koodle-doodle doo!

3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," Wait, wait, wait! I got the perfect thing!"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," That's enough, okay? I will give it one day, all right? I'll see if there's any evidence of these nefarious Brits, but I'm warning you, if I can't, we're pleading guilty, and you're either going back to jail or if the judge shows absolutely no mercy at all, you'll be staying here with my mother."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," Lindsay, didn't want to tell you earlier, but I did get you a car."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay, No way? Is it a Lexus?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, It's more like a Lincoln.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," Coka-coh! Coka-coh! Coka-coh! Oh, come on!"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," There's no satellite radio, but there's a banjo in the closet. And watch out for live-ins. You will get some live-ins."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator, Michael was investigating his father's case in the English section of Orange County.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Voices," Lanes reverse, mate! You're driving on the wrong side, you blooming idiot!"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, I need to check the records for any British-owned building businesses that would've applied for a license about ten years ago.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Ian," Oh, I'm so sorry. You'll need a UK passport to check those files. They're for British eyes only."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, Don't I look kind of British?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Ian, Perhaps if you're willing to lose 20 pounds.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator," The clerk was asking for a bribe, but this was lost on Michael."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," Well, you guys do go for the jugular."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Ian,00. And do stay for the Poppuns.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator, So Michael went to the local pub...
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Voices, Bloody Yank!
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator, ...to see if he could find someone with a British passport.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lionel," Welcome to the Yellowfang. I am Lionel, and the soup of the day is... What's the soup of the day, Mum?!"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lionel's Mum, Bread.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lionel, And the soup of the day is bread. Unless you're just here for the Poppuns.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator, And that's when Michael saw the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen. Not her. Wait for it...
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, Are you from Wee Britain?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Rita," Great Britain, actually."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, Great. I was wondering if you might be willing to go somewhere with me. I would pay you.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Rita, You'll pay me?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," Not... Not for sex. You're going to think that I'm Jack the Ripper, right? Didn't he kill prostitutes or...?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Rita, I'm not a prostitute.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, Then I shall let you live. (Chuckles.) This is my worst hello. Let me try again. My name is Michael.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Rita, Rita.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, I need access to these files that are apparently for British eyes only.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Rita," Well, lucky for you, my whole face is British."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael,0
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Ian," Oh, yes, GMT. Everything here is on Greenwich Mean Time."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, What a curious street. Rita... I don't suppose that you're here tomorrow morning?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Rita," Oh, no, not in the morning, no. I'll be back at Slowbrooke."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," Slowbrooke. The private school? Oh, you teach kids, huh?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Rita, I like to think they teach me.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," Like what, how to eat crayons, throw tantrums..."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Rita," Oh, no, not when I'm there. I'm very good."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," I-I didn't mean to, uh, impugn your ability, or, uh... It's turning into one of my worst good-byes. Farewell, and, uh... our paths shan't cross again. As you like it."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator," Michael would have walked away forever, had he not been struck by something he remembered from his childhood."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, You know... Well... must be the Poppuns.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Rita," Oh, I'm sorry. It's wrong to laugh."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," No, no, no, it's good. I liked it. It's just, I was going to ask you, preschools just go half-day, right? And I'm not... I'm not trying to pick you up, but is there any way that I can... I can come by, pick you up, bring you here?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Rita," Yeah, I-I, um... I suppose I could... sneak out at nap time."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," Yes? Perfect. Great. And I shall drop you off alive, hooker or no. (Mouthing.)"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator," Tobias, still hoping to be in G.O.B.'s trick, ventured into a costume shop he'd stumbled upon..."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Coco, Oh! Look who's back.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator, ...years earlier.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Coco," Are you going to buy this time, or you just curious?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Tobias," I suppose I'm, uh... buy-curious."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Tobias, (Chuckles.) I have a big TV opportunity.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Coco, This is where all the big TV's come.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Tobias," Uh, let's start with the Eve Arden."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Coco, All right.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator," Michael, meanwhile, called his sister."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," I wanted to call and tell you that I got myself a date with a beautiful woman named Rita, and you're the chicken, not me. Cluck-cluck-cluck-cluck..."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, (Screams.)
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay," Okay, that's a pretty good chicken."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, Watch out!
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Voices, Crazy Brit!
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, What's the problem?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Trevor," I know what you were doing back there. If you've got half a bleeping brain, you'll leave it alone."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, You talking about back in Wee Britain? I was just asking a few questions.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Trevor," Yeah, a few too many, if you ask me. How would you like someone going after some stupid person in your family? Now, back off, you bleeping ponce!"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, Wow! Dad was not kidding about their breath.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator, Michael had just been threatened by a foul-mouthed British man.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B., It's Michael. I'm not dressed.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," G.O.B., this is Michael. Shouldn't you be getting ready for your ""Free Bird"" trick?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," I couldn't get the rights to ""Free Bird."""
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, Oh.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," I'm thinking about calling it ""Free..."" I don't know, ""Chicken."" I thought you were investigating Dad's sinister British connection."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," Yeah, I tried, but... but when I was leaving, one of those British guys came after me and told me to back off. Can't believe it, but Dad may have been telling the truth. This might be dangerous."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B., So you came back here to hide like a child.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," What are you doing locked in my office, exactly?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B., Hiding from a child. Big difference.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," G.O.B., Steve Holt is your son. He probably just feels a connection."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B., He doesn't know what he feels! I'm tired of being told...
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," My God, what is this feeling?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," Well, you know the-the feeling that you're... that you're feeling is-is what many of us call ""a feeling."""
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," But it's not like envy, or even hungry."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, Could it be love?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's... it's like my heart is getting hard. Maybe I am ready to be a father."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George Michael," Hey, Dad?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," It's my son, G.O.B. What is it with the fathers in this family? Always trying to deceive their..."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator," And that's when Michael realized that the man who threatened him must have been hired by George, Sr."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," I'm the patsy. Well, I got to go. George Michael, I'm sorry, but we're going to talk about that girl later, okay?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," Now all I have to do is find that look-alike, Michael."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Tobias, Michael... Hey!
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B., That's a woman's wig.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Tobias," I was told it was a ""Bob."""
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator, And Michael confronted his father.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George, Find out anything?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," Yeah, I did, Dad. I found out that no matter how many times I promise myself that I'm not going to fall for it, I always end up getting hustled by you."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George, What are you talking about?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, The guy that you hired to threaten me after I looked into the British connection.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Somebody threatened you?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael,00 in the afternoon. And you can forget about pleading not guilty.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," Guilty, we got to plead guilty."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, What?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," Michael, I didn't hire anyone. I-I-I swear. If someone came after you, they're for real."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," Come on, you're serious?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," I told you, these are bad guys. They do not want this information out."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, He said that he was going to come after somebody stupid in our family- that could be Buster.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George, Could be G.O.B.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, You're not guilty.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George, We have to plead guilty.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, We've got to plead guilty.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George, We've got to throw ourselves on the mercy of the court.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, We got to get Andy Griffith.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George, Andy Griffith in the suit.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator, And Michael went to cancel with Rita.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," Sorry. I just wanted to let you know that I'm not going to be needing your passport, after all. We're just going to go to court, plead guilty- that'll be that."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Rita," So it's bye-bye to Rita, then?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," Yes, I'll shake your hand good-bye, but actually, I was wondering if-if you might want to..."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Rita, I wouldn't. I'll make you blue.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator," Rita was just talking about the fingerpaint, but Michael didn't know that."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, I was just wondering if you might want to bid me fair 'morrow. That's all. See ya.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator," Michael was filled with self-loathing. Had he been Jack the Ripper he would have soothed himself in a most unsavory way. But instead, he just sat in his car and ate a whole thing of candy beans."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator," And back at the penthouse, G.O.B. had been called to see his father."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," It's a new plan, right? You put me in the trick. You make me the guy in the cage."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," Okay, I just got to say I'm really blown away by this. You really want to be part of my world."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George, I do.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," God, I feel like my heart is straining through my shirt."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," They take the ankle monitor off when I get to court, so you make me disappear, you put Tobias in the cage- and by the time they realize that that guy is not me, I'm running through the storm drains to freedom."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," Where every day it rains... pennies from heaven. It was... ""bird"" today..."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Tobias," G.O.B., I know you're looking for a twin for your illusion, and there's somebody I'd like to put in a plug for. Uh, correction- make that 4,000 plugs."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," Oh, God."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," Oh, come on!"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lupe," Meestagay , he's bleeding! Meestagay...!"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Tobias," No, no, no, no. I-I was scared too, but I realized it was of being a leading man. Oh, I can just taste those meaty leading man parts in my mouth."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," All right, listen to me, the trick has changed. We want you to play me now."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Tobias," Oh, but that would mean I'd have to sh... shave my very tender head. I see, okay. Well, perhaps I jumped the gun on those new head shots."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator," And later that day, Michael arrived at the courthouse with his sister."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay, I can't believe you're just giving up like this.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, The guy threatened our family. We have to plead guilty.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay," No, I'm talking about that girl you said you had a date with."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," All right, so I lied- it wasn't a date."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay, But you could have made one with her. I think that Poppuns knocked the courage out of you.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, I guess I'm just not in her league. How did you hear about the Poppuns?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay, It was on the news.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,John Beard, An unlicensed Mary Poppuns takes down another tourist. Is this the work of the Itsy-Bitsy IRA?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," I don't want to talk about this right now. Dad, we're going to go in there- Andy Griffith's going to whisper something, we're going to plead guilty, nice and simple."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," You didn't hear, we lost Andy."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, What? What are you talking about? He didn't like his trailer.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay, He thought we were making fun of him.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator, No one was making fun of Andy Griffith. I can't emphasize that enough.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lucille," Oh, God, don't look now, but G.O.B.'s doing his magic show."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," Oh, boy, a stupid magic show. We got to watch this."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay, A big turnout.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, I think a lot of people are probably here for the free chicken.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," Gather 'round, humans... and I will show you the plight of an innocent man who yearns to be free... as a bird! I've got to start labeling these suits. Who shall I send on this journey to that dangling cage?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," Oh, pick me. Oh! Look, can I be in his stupid trick? Please?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B.," Steve Holt, what are you doing here?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Steve Holt, I just came to see the magic show. I didn't know it was you.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B., Do you like magic?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Steve Holt, No. I love it!
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator," And at that moment, G.O.B. chose to show his own son what he was capable of."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B., I've decided I will be performing the feat myself!
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Tobias, Wait... we're back to hair?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator," Fortunately for Tobias, however, he'd found it too painful to part with his new hair."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Tobias," Boy, did I catch a break."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator, So he opted to wear a bald cap.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B., This chicken shall be wrongly cooped.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Voices, What's in his hand? Is that chicken?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Steve Holt," Oh, my God! Dad, are you all right?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Tobias, I fooled his own son. I am a leading man.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator," And G.O.B. himself was running through the storm drains, free as a chicken."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,G.O.B., Sounds too good. I'm not ready.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator," And George, Sr. needed to escape, too."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lucille, I got him.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lucille, Keeps him out of the kitchen.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator," And Michael, seeing what a life of cowardice leads to, decided he'd had enough of it. And soon, George, Sr. came to, and it was time to render a plea."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," Oh, no."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, Hmm?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George, The prosecution's got that stud from LA Law.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Harry Hamlin, I love my trailer.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Judge #2," In the matter the of People v. Bluth, how do you plead?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, We plead... not guilty.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,George," Michael, what are you doing?"
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, I'm tired of the cowardice. You're not guilty. We're going to fight this. We've got the truth on our side.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Harry Hamlin, They don't have a ( bleep ) prayer. Send the check to my accountant.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, This is where Andy could have helped us.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay," Well, I'm proud of you."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, It's about time I showed a little courage.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay, I just hope those Brits aren't as dangerous as Dad says.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael," Well, they're not going to get any closer to us. If they do, we're going to see them coming. Oh, my God. That's Rita. I told her I was coming here, and she came."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay, That's Rita?
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, Yeah.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Lindsay, Wow. She is way out of his league.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, I'm glad you're here. I want to call you sometime and take you out.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Rita," Oh, I'd really like that."
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Michael, (Whispers.) Good.
3,For British Eyes Only,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_For_British_Eyes_Only,Narrator," And then just to prove he wasn't a coward, he went one step further. And Rita was happy to be in Michael's life, as well. For you see, Rita... had a secret of her own."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, Michael Bluth and his family were meeting with their new attorney.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Bob Loblaw," Look, this is not the first time I've been brought in to replace Barry Zuckerkorn. I think I can do for you everything he did. Plus, skew younger. With juries and so forth. Any other questions?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay, Yes. How can you be even cuter in person than you are in your ads?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Man on Television," Are you a CEO, CFO or other executive facing these or similar charges? Why should you go to jail for a crime someone else noticed? You don't need double-talk."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Bob Loblaw, You need Bob Loblaw.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Man on Television," Bob Loblaw, no habla español."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Well, we're not here to talk nonsense to Bob Loblaw. We need to find out if the government has a good case against us. There was a lot of proof that my father was building houses in Iraq."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Bob Loblaw," Well, your father claims he was put up to it by a British syndicate. And you've been threatened, isn't that correct?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, It was.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Trevor," How would you like someone going after some stupid person in your family? Now back off, you bleeping ponce!"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, It's been a week. Nothing's happened.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Larry," Yeah, but you're not the one stuck under house arrest like a sitting duck."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Oh, yeah, that's my father. That's why we had the meeting here- so that he couldn't interfere."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Larry, Interfere? I ought to pull down your pants and spank your ass raw.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, I'm sorry. Have we met?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Bob Loblaw," Oh, yes, this Larry Middleman. He's your father's surrogate."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, Surrogate?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Larry," That's right, you dumb bleep."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,"George, Sr.", I hired this guy to wear a camera in his hat so he could be my eyes and ears while I'm stuck in this penthouse.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Larry," This camera helps me keep tabs on you idiots, while this thing rubs my ankle raw."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,"George, Sr."," I mean, look at this thing..."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Larry, ... I can't even go in the hallway ...
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,"George, Sr.", ... without hearing that ...
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Larry," ... beep, beep, beep."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Bob Loblaw, That's one of my partners. Excuse me.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay, I would like to be one of your partners. Do you think he got that- the two meanings?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, He's running pretty fast. I think he did.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay," Well, he was flirting earlier, I'll tell you that."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay, Just so you know... I'm looking to get divorced. Are you interested?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Bob Loblaw, Yes. (To stenographer) Let's call that a half hour.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay, So you're not the only one who's got a date later.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B., You've got a date?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, Her name's Rita. She teaches children at a private school and we're just having lunch.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," Oh, lunch? Well, better bring some dog food. 'Cause all the girls you date are dogs, and... dogs love dog food, right, Pop?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Larry," Shut up, you idiot. I'm trying to watch the game."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," I was trying to make you laugh, Dad. That's all I ever wanted."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," You know, G.O.B., she's not a dog. It's the just opposite, actually. She's exquisitely beautiful. She's fun, carefree, smart, full of surprises."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, Including the fact that she was working with this man- who was currently dropping her off for her date.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Trevor, All this fun and carefree act is only going to fool him for so long.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, I'm a big girl.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Trevor," Yeah. Well, if he finds out what you really are he might not make things so simple for you. Rita, don't forget your hat."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," I know, might be too good for me."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay," How do you think I feel? Bob Loblaw's a handsome, professional man and I'm only used to... well, none of those things."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Tobias," Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was a professional twice over- an analyst and a therapist. The world's first analrapist."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay," Yes, and you were almost arrested for those business cards."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Tobias," Yes. No, it did not look good on paper but I didn't stop because of the police inquiries, I stopped to raise our little daughter. But since we have both started to grow hair in unexpected places, I suppose I shall soon be working as a leading man. And she may soon start dating."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, Maeby had already started dating.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Maeby," All right, see you tomorrow night."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,George Michael, Another date with Steve Holt?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Maeby, Yeah. We're getting pretty serious.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, They weren't. She was just avoiding her real crush on George Michael.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Maeby, That Steve sure knows how to please a lady.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,George Michael," Good. I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. I guess it makes sense, you know, older guys expect certain things."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Maeby, They do?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,George Michael," What a fun, sexy time for you."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Bob Loblaw, I'd be very careful of these British people. They're going to try to get their hands on any evidence they can to hurt the family.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,"George, Sr.", So you're saying shred the evidence?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Bob Loblaw," No, that's illegal. The prosecution is entitled to that evidence. Without it, they don't have a case."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,"George, Sr.", So you're saying shred the evidence?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Bob Loblaw, That's a felony. And I certainly couldn't endorse anything like that.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,"George, Sr.", Got ya. Wink.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Larry," Wink. Did you say ""wink"" or did you wink?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," He said that, too, Dad."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Bob Loblaw," We'll talk soon, folks. Thank you."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Larry, Where you going? Where is the surrogate going? Stay there. I want to see what he's going to say. Don't leave.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," See you, Pop."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Look. G.O.B., instead of trying to impress your fake father, maybe you should spend some time with your real son."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B., Steve Holt's not my son.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,George Michael," Steve Holt? What, the moron jock?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," That's my son, you pothead."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Hey, hey, hey, that's my son."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,George Michael," Wait, so that means that Steve Holt is my cousin? And Maeby's cousin, too?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, I guess.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Shoot, I'm late for my date."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," At the kennel. Right. Sorry. You lobbed that one right over the plate, Michael. Home run."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, And Michael hurried to the British section Orange County for his date.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Voices, ...American! Get out of the road.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, Only to find that Rita had chosen Wee Britain's one American-themed restaurant.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Oh, hello. I'm sorry I'm late."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita," Oh, no bother. I've been having such fun on this space shuttle."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Strike one, huh? Shall we go ahead and sit down?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Waiter #6," (In a Texas-British accent) Hey, dudes, I'll get you a couple of 64-ounce colas to wash down this basket of doughnut and get your nachos started."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, I guess this is what the British think of Americans. They like our food.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, Whatever do you mean?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Yeah. Uh... you ow, Rita, you're going to figure this out eventually, but I have not been on a date in a long, long time."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, (Muffled) Neither have I.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," I wonder why? No, I bet men ask you out constantly."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, Not men like you. I seem to only meet little boys.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, Part of that might be that you spend your day at a preschool.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, And they think the stupidest things are funny.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Yeah, that's a cultural problem, is what it is. You know, your average American male is in perpetual state of adoscence, you know, arrested development."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator," Hey, that's the name of the show."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," No attention span. You know, can't even carry on a typical con..."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, Michael thought he spotted the man who'd threatened him earlier.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, I'm getting back on the space shuttle.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," No, no, no. Sorry, sor. Sit, please. Let's talk about you. Tell me about your family."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita," No. They're pushy, bossy, want to control me. What about your family? I'd love to meet your family."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, Michael knew from experience that this would not turn out well.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," If you like the small, why don't you come back for the medium?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, I probably should warn you about my mother...
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Marta 3.0, Hi.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille, Let's start behind the fridge.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator," So he came up with a solution so simple, he'd wondered why he'd never told anyone it before."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, I don't have a family. I can't believe I've never told anybody that before.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, That's so sad.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Yes,that's sad. Super sad. Shall we eat?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, Michael had started a relationship by lying about the existence of his family.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," I think this went really well, huh? Maybe sometime we can have dinner?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, Could I see your house?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, Michael was caught off guard by the question.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," No, no, I-I can't do that."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita," Okay, bye-bye."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, Uh... bye.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, And he vow not to be caught off guard again.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, I didn't mean that we... Oof!
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Trevor," So did he invite you over, then?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita," Not yet, but he will."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator," So, Michael went back to work."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Hey, who brought in the...? G.O.B., you can't shred this evidence. You'll end up in jail."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B., Dad told me to. How can I say no to that face?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Get this stuff out of here, and put it somewhere where Dad can't get to it. Are you in on this, too?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille," No, I'm just here to go out to lunch with your father."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Man on Television, The man said he's never felt more free in his life.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Man, I'm like a bird up there...
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster," Ah, did you tell him about my medal?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, Medal? What for?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille," Oh, who knows what they were saying?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Army Sergeant," (Speaking very fast) ...private citizenship and hereby reenlist in the armed services of the United States of America? If you agree with this, say thank you."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster, Thank you. Wow. I have so many people to thank.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Army Sergeant," Private, step forward."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille, It's probably because a seal bit off his hand. The army has taken to giving medals for being food.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, And just then...
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Television, Wow! Look at him go tied to that deck chair!
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,"George, Sr.", It's so simple. My ankle monitor...
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Larry, ...only goes off when go out the front or. We need balloons. A party.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,"George, Sr.", We need to throw a party...
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Larry," ...for Buster's stupid thing. Larry, go get go get some balloons."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, And Michael found a way get Rita to his house after all.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," That's a great idea. Honor Buster tomorrow night. We'll get the whole family over to the penthouse, show him our support."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille," Well, I suppose it's better than drinking alone. What time?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, It doesn't matter to me. I can't be there. I've got a date with Rita.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster," Well, Mom's probably right. I couldn't even stand up to a seal. I don't real deserve a medal or a party."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Tobias," No, you deserve this. Here, take my business card."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster, Gah!
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Tobias," No, no, it's pronounced ah-NAL-rah-pist."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster, It wasn't really the pronunciation that bothered me.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Tobias," You see, Buster, it wasn't the seal that you couldn't stand up to. It was... Lucille."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster, (Gasps)
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Tobias," (Gasps) Oh, I'm getting chills. If this was a Lifetime Moment of Truth movie, this would be our act break."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, But it wasn't.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay, The thing about Tobias- that he's never fulfilled me sexually.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Bob Loblaw, Can you catalog for me the various ways you've been promised to be fulfilled whether or not said promise was made explicit?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay, You want me to be explicit?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Bob Loblaw," Yes, but I will be needing to get off in four minutes."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay," Well, let's see if I can't hit that target for you."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator," The next day on the way pick up Rita, Michael stopped by his house to make sure there were no signs of his family only to discover there was nothing but."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, What the hell is all this?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster," Oh, G.O.B. brought all this stuff in."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," And, Mom, what is with all the family photos?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Tobias," Oh, I'm teaching Buster to stand up for himself. I'm surrogating your mother."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, By wearing her sealskin coat?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Tobias," Michael, I have tried on everything, and nothing seems be working."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster, I thought the Donna Karan worked; you just didn't have the right shoes.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Look, I've got to get rid of any evidence of my family and quickly- including you guys. Get out of here."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Tobias," See, now that's how you stand up to Mother."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator," Meanwhile, worried about Steve Holt's sexual expectations, Maeby tried to cancel her date."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Maeby," My whole family and I now have to go to my grandma's house, 'cause my uncle lost his hand."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Steve Holt, Awesome! So you and I can party alone at your house.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator," Maeby was too young to know what to do. Ironically, in her after-school job as a movie studio executive, she'd just green-lit two films that dealt with that very issue."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Maeby, Rock the house.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Steve Holt, All right.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator," George Michael also didn't know what to do. If he pointed out that the two were cousins to drive them apart, he might be burning the very bridge that he one day hoped to cross."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Steve Holt, George Michael. I'm doing your cousin tonight.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,George Michael, So are you.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Steve Holt, What?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,George Michael," She's your cousin, too."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator," Back at the penthouse, party preparations were underway."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille, He's not wearing that to the party. I've got the exact same thing.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster," No, he was just analraping me. Then Michael barged in, and kicked us out so he could shred all the evidence."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille, Shred the evidence?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,"George, Sr.", Thought he didn't want us to do that.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B., He didn't want us to get into trouble. He's taking the heat.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay, He's doing that for us? And on the night of his date with Rita.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille," Who he didn't want to bring over here. Probably because, let's face it, you people haven't been great with the others."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," Well, in our defense, Mom, we're not exactly dog people."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay, We have got to start being nicer.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille," I'm starting right now. Buster, the party's not for you anymore. It's a ""Welcome Rita"" party."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay, I know where she works. We can pick her up and surprise her.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster, You're so right. This is better an a party for me.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Tobias, Come on. Grow a pair.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,"George, Sr."," You know, need some weather balloons for this party and maybe a tank of hydrogen. You know, really float those suckers."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator," Meanwhile, Michael was hiding the evidence wherever he could when he heard from his brother."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," (On answering machine) Hey, friend! G.O.B. here. We really want you at the party. We're really nice now, and God, we love you."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Oh, damn it."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, And the family picked up Rita in the only vehicle big enough to hold them all.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay," Hey, excuse me, Rita."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, I'm Rita.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay, We're here to pick you up for Michael. You can just go in the cabin.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, Michael?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille," Oh, he's not here. We're his family."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, His family?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B., We're nice.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, I'm sorry. I have to leave.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille," Oh, no, you can't leave. Drive, Lindsay."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Children, Bye!
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B., We're doing this for Michael.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille," Stop her, Buster."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster, What am I supposed to do?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille, Stop her!
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster, Stop yelling at me!
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, I'm leaving!
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, And that's when Buster noticed the seal on Rita's backpack.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster, (Shrieks.)
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, (Shrieks.)
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster, (Whimpers.)
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Tobias," Hey, talk about cathartic. Now that's an act break."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator," Buster had overcome his fear of seals. Unfortunately, he'd done so by knocking out Michael's new girlfriend."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille, What the hell did you do?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster," You curious, Mom? I can show you."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille, You made a mistake. You're human except for the hand.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," It's okay, she's alive. And soft. Soft and alive."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille," All right, let's not add that to the charges. What do we do? She's going to tell Michael. And he won't hear the good stuff. He'll just hear about the beating."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," Wait! Maybe we can give her a Forget-Me-Now. (Singsong.) Here you go, hot dog. Take the pill."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille, What's a Forget-Me-Now?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," They're pills that create a sort of temporary forgettingness. So if somebody finds out how you do a trick, you just give 'em one of these, and they forget the whole thing. It's a mainstay of the magician's toolkit, like how clowns always have a rag soaked in ether."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Tobias," G.O.B., this is Flunitrazepam. It's a roofie."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille, Those are illegal.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," Shut up, Mom. Don't make me give you another one of these. Lindsay, help me! Three!"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator," Back at the house, Michael finished his work and now late, rushed to pick up Rita. Moments later, Maeby prepared to tell Steve she wasn't ready for romance."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Maeby," Well, this sends a mixed message."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, Just as Steve showed up to call things off with his cousin.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Steve Holt, You did all this for me?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Maeby," Yes, well, I'm going to go get sexy."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, And Michael missed Rita.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, Damn it. Strike two.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille," Take it down. We don't want anything in this use that says ""Rita."""
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," (On answering phone.) Hi, it's Michael. I will be coming to the party because I love you, too."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille," Okay, we need a new banner."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, And that's when Michael found Rita.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, Rita...
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita," Why am I on a bus bench, Michael?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," I get it; because I'm late. I'm sorry, but the rest of the night's going to be all about you, I promise. Great, great. I am going to have to make one quick stop. Maybe you can just wait in the car. It's just going to be two seconds, I promise."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, And so Michael raced up to pay his quick respect to Buster.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,"George, Sr."," Ah, there he is, my favorite son."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Tobias, Everybody's favorite son!
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B., Mr. Wonderful!
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," I had a great time. I wish I could have stayed longer. It was a great party, huh? Tell Buster I stopped by, please. I do have to leave, though."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille," Oh, no, no. The party is not for Buster anymore."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay," No, Michael, it's for you."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," Take a look at banner, Michael!"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," You guys did all of this for me? ""Family love..."""
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, Michael?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator," Everyone froze. Michael feared he'd been caught in a lie about his family. His family feared they'd been caught by a woman they clubbed, drugged and left on a bench. It was awkward."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille, Who's this?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster," Mother! Mother! This is from Army. I have to report for duty tomorrow. It says by accepting this medal, I was reenlisting."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille, I didn't hear them say that.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, Perhaps if the sergeant had spoken more slowly she would have.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Army Sergeant," In acceptance of this medal, you proudly waive all rights to private citizenship and hereby reenlist in the armed services of the Unites States of America. If you agree with this, say thank you."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster, (Speaking very slowly) Than-nk... you.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster, What am I going to do? I can't go back there. I've never been.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, Who are these people?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, This is my family.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita," No. No, I don't like these people."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Me, you mean. She means me, because I lied about having a family because I was embarrassed by them. And I'm ashamed of that."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, I have to leave.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, Strike three.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay, You said you didn't have a family?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B., Everybody's favorite son.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Tobias, Mr. Terrible.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille," And her, too good for us? Huh! Buster, you should have finished the job. Job? What job? Did I say job? I meant G.O.B."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B., Buster's the one that hit her! I just gave her the roofie.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, Roofie?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B., Forget-Me-Now.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, You beat and drugged Rita?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B., Take this and love us again!
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," No, no! No, no, G.O.B.!"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," No, Just take it!"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Um, I'm leaving, too."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lucille," Well, no good deed goes unpunished."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Tobias," Oh, look, it's not all bad. I-I got Buster feeling better about his medal."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Buster, Not anymore. I'm getting rid of this thing. It has caused me nothing but pride and self-respect!
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator," Buster went to get rid of the medal he finally felt he deserved, but it was exactly when George, Sr. was making his escape."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,"George, Sr.", Farewell to you all!
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, But it turns out that hydrogen is more explosive than helium.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, And George Michael came home to find an unconscious Steve Holt.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,George Michael, What have you guys been doing?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Maeby, I gave him a roofie. A girl's got to grow up sometime.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,George Michael, He's your cousin.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Maeby, My cousin?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,George Michael, I should have told you that. Now you've drugged him and had your way with him. How is that even possible?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Maeby," No, George Michael, we didn't do anything. I just wanted him to think we did. Don't you see? I drugged him not to go all the way with him."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,George Michael," Well, I think even the anti-drug people are going to be okay with that."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Maeby," Well, let's get his pants back on."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,George Michael, You took his pants off?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, And Michael tried to salvage the remains of the files from the car fire.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay, You call the attorney?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Yeah, I sure did, but he's not taking our calls because apparently the retainer's all used up."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay, He took my call. He's very good.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Yeah, that's how the retainer got eaten up, okay? The secretary took it all down here on the transcript."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay," She's very good, too."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael, I'm not paying for this.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay," Well, what am I supposed to do?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," I don't know, Lindsay. The thing you say on page seven looks like it could be worth some money."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B., Speaking to me yet?
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," It's only been an hour. You know, here, here's what I don't understand. What were you guys doing with Rita in the first place?"
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," We just wanted to do something nice for you, Michael, because you do so much for us. I guess we screwed it up."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Well I screwed it up because I was trying to impress her and let's face it, she's probably too good for me."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," No. What you need to do is go to her and ask for another chance. She'd be lucky to have you, Michael."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Thanks, G.O.B. Sometimes you do surprise me."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B., I've got one more surprise for you. (As Franklin) / It ain't easy being whi... 
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator," And Michael did try again with Rita, but this time, determined to keep no secrets."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," I, uh, I want to tell you everything if, if you're willing to listen."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Rita, I'm a very good listener.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Michael," Great. We'll start with the misdemeanors and then we're going to push right on through to the lighter treasons. So, 1983, uh..."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, Lindsay tries to work off her debt with Bob Loblaw..."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay, I'm willing to debase myself.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Bob Loblaw,0
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Lindsay, There is no way to misinterpret that.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Narrator, Except the one. ... and a traumatized Steve Holt needs a father.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Steve Holt, I've made a huge mistake.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B.," I know the feeling. I had you. I'm your father, Steve Holt! I can't hide from it anymore."
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,Steve Holt, I won't forget this... Dad.
3,Forget-Me-Now,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Forget-Me-Now,G.O.B., (Popping roofie) I will. I will.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," Michael was heading to work when he saw something he had never seen before lunch, his twin sister Lindsay."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, You're up?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Lindsay," Yeah, I work for our attorney now."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Bob Loblaw, of course. What is he thinking? I mean, how's it going?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Lindsay," Lousy. I only took this nanny job so he'd give me a free divorce, and then marry me, so I'd never have to work again. But all he seems to care about is that daughter of his."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Hope, I got my horse to canter today-first time.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Lindsay, I've always wanted to make love on a horse.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Hope," And tomorrow, we're going to work without a lunge-line."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Lindsay," That's so funny, because I can put my leg behind my head. I mean, come on, I'm the nanny..."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Lindsay, Snog? Is that another one of your new British-isms?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, It was. Michael had recently fallen bum-over-noggin for a beautiful Englishwoman called Rita.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Did I say ""snog"" again? Oh, bloody hell. Listen, you want to win over Bob, you got to win over the kid, and here's what you do. You find something that you're good at, and you share it with her. And while you're at it, share it with us, too. And try to not to act so desperate. Oh, my God! Did I miss a call?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Rita," (On answering machine.) This is Rita. Just wanted to say ""hi."" I'm on my way to the train station. Bye-bye."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, She's leaving. I've got to get over there!
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, Michael raced to the station...
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Lindsay," God, is that how I look?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, ...where Rita was being given her ticket.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Trevor, ...and your instructions. Call me if you get in over your head.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Hey, hi, there, Rita. Hey... Michael. Hi. Where are you going and how long you going for? You're right. Do not answer that. You know, I'm not getting clingy."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Rita, Why are you breathing like that?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Oh, I wasn't hurrying to come stop you. I was out on for my daily, uh... Do you run at all?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Rita," Oh, yes. I was in the Olympics once. I won a silver medal."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," You're that Rita Leeds? Oh, my goodness. And the silver medal. Yes, and you came in second. Now I'm very embarrassed to be out of breath in front of you. But you take my breath away."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Rita," Oh, Michael. You're such bleep."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," Michael was stunned. He assumed Rita was using the word bleep in the American sense, meaning weak or cowardly. In fact, Rita meant it in the British sense, meaning sweet or gentle, as in ""pussycat."""
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Reggie, The Jerries aren't so bad. They're just being led by a rotten apple.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Adelaide," Oh, Reggie. Fighting for your country- you're such a pussy."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Reggie," When I miss your lips, I'll put a bleep in my mouth and think of you."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, That also had a different meaning over there.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," Michael returned home, hoping to take solace in his son's company."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Hey, just the guy I was looking for. Thinking you and I should maybe go play a little catch, you know? Maybe go for a run. Do some guy stuff."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael, But we're not good at that stuff.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Yes, I am. We... both are."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," Michael and his son had never been a very successful athletic team. In fact, the only thing George Michael really liked was hanging motionless from the monkey bars. Which the President's Council on Fitness ranks as ""slightly easier than the slide."""
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Anyway, I was just thinking that maybe we should emphasize athletics a little bit more in this family. I'm gonna start us off with a protein drink, okay? (Throws a glass at George Michael.)"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Still doing that, huh?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Well, I do think we should go for a run, huh? Some real guy stuff."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael, I'm supposed to go fabric shopping with Ann today.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, I think we can go butcher.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael," Uh, uh, no. We're making a gown. She's gonna be in a beauty pageant."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Yeah, who's Ann?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael, My-My girlfriend. She's... You've met her so many times- met her and met her...
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, No. I know who Annabelle is. Who's the Ann that's in the beauty pageant?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael," That's her. Her name isn't Annabelle, that's Ann."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," No, I know her name's not Annabelle. That's how I remember her name, 'cause her body's kind of shaped like a... She's the belle of the ball."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, What is she doing in the beauty pageant? She's... she running the lights or something?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael, She's in it. She's a contestant. It's sort of like an inner beauty pageant.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, Ah! There it is. Is it like a Christian thing?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," As a child, Maeby had been entered into a number of progressive pageants that claimed to celebrate beauty in all its forms. But the winners still tended to have it ""going on"" in the conventional sense."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Lindsay, Remember how badly you used to want to win?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Maeby," No, I remember how badly you used to want me to win."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Lindsay," Yeah, we should have."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Lindsay, I don't know where that hair of yours came from.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Tobias," Shameless Plugs, on Placentia. Looks pretty good, huh? And they're not licensed, which means big savings."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Tobias, That's been happening a lot lately.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Lindsay, You know what? This is the perfect thing to do.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Maeby," No, Mom, I'm not gonna do it."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Lindsay," Oh, no, no, not you. Bob's daughter, Hope. If I can get Hope this crown, maybe her father might just want to crown me, if you know what I mean."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," I'm guessing ""have sex"", but that's meeting you more than halfway."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, Tobias. Want to clean up that... mirror? And the vase?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Tobias, Perhaps if I can coach a certain young lady to victory in this pageant I can gain back the respect of my wife. I'll show them a little T and A.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Maeby," You can't make me do it, Dad."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Tobias, Tobias and Ann.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael," My Ann? No, I don't think we need any help."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Tobias," Oh, George Michael, she's a girl. I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Yeah, I think you just did."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B., Michael.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, G.O.B.?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B.," Oh, let me get that for you. Um, so..."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B., A young neighborhood tough by the name of Steve Holt's gonna be here any minute.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, Your son.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B., According to him.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, And a DNA test.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B., I heard the jury's still out on science.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B.," Anyway, he wants to go to the fair, but I don't want to hurt his feelings. So, I need you to do it. Just tell him that I'm out of town on one of my trips."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, I'm not gonna lie to your son.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B.," Come on. I lie to yours all the time. Michael, I'm not ready to be a dad. Plus, I'm gonna be very busy this week being a judge for the pageant."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B., You can't believe what it does for your sex life.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, I don't want to hear it.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B.," I don't want to say it. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. Second place is someone weird usually, like a Chinese girl or a geologist. But third place, although a little bit plain, has super low self-esteem. So I step in and, uh, lay her crown upon my sweet head."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, Have I missed this euphemism?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt, Steve Holt!
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B., I should go.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt," He's hiding from me, isn't he?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," You know, uh, you got to stop saying your name all the time."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt," It's just, they have this father-son triathlon and... I just wanted him to do it with me. Stupid, huh?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Oh, that's a pretty tough race."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt," Only for a wimp, a wuss, a bleep."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, And Steve didn't mean pussycat.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Uh, Steve... how'd you like to do that triathlon with me?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt, Are you serious?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, Yeah.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt, Uncle Mike!
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, Steve Holt!
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, Both men felt good about themselves.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, Uncle Mike!
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt, Steve Holt!
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, But G.O.B. didn't share their enthusiasm.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B.," So this is how Michael gets rid of my son? By stealing him? Well, I'll just have to steal something of his. Like, say, his bicycle. (Menacingly.) As a... placeholder."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, Michael was trying to prove his manliness with Steve Holt.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Rita. Hey, it's Michael. Just want to let you know that I'm running the triathlon at the fair, and if you're back in t... Oh, I can't believe I chose this moment to call you."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," Meanwhile, at the Church and State Fair, Maeby was trying to enroll in the pageant. Sort of."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Fran, Your situation poses a problem. Let me talk to our chairman.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael," Hey, what are you doing, Maeby?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Maeby," It's Surely. I'm just here to prove that all these pageants care about is looks. Just watch, Surely's inner beauty will get trumped by her outer icky."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael, What happened to your nose?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Maeby, It's part of the disguise. Isn't it cool? The same one Nicole Kidman wore in The Hours.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, It had been purchased for her at a charity auction she'd attended as a studio executive...
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Jamie Kennedy,"$10,000.00 "
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, ... by Jamie Kennedy.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Fran," Miss Woolfbeak, although it costs quite a bit to put in a ramp for you, we got approval. You're in."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," As Maeby found herself stuck in a beauty pageant, Lucille was meeting with attorney Bob Loblaw about getting her son out of the Army."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Lucille," My God, he's already lost a hand. If he loses a leg, how will we ever get him out of the apartment?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Bob Loblaw," Well, the Army does have a one-in-one-out program, where the inductee is relieved of duty once he enlists someone to take his place."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Buster," So I'm supposed to find some poor, innocent soul and hook him?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Lucille," Well, that's not going to help sign anyone. Where's your hand?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Buster," Oh, it got stuck in the prize hole again."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Buster, Ah! There goes number three.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Hi, sorry, sorry, totally forgot about this meeting. What's going on?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Bob Loblaw, Your father's gotten a lot of bad press because of the escape attempts. Volunteer for something.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Larry, I'll do anything to get out of this bleeping apartment.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Lucille, You'll do anything to get out of bleeping in this apartment.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Larry," Ah, you're drunk."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Yeah, Mom, can you just... And Dad... You know, why do we even need the surrogate? You know, Dad's in the apartment."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Larry, Don't come in here.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George, Don't come in here. I said not to come in.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Would you get out here, please?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George, I'm watching the game.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Larry, I said not to come in.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, I did not spending money on a surrogate so you can hust...
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Larry, I'm watching the game. I lost him.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, You've got your hands full trying to make this guy look good.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Bob Loblaw," There's a ""Startled Straight"" program at the fair, which involves you speaking with at-risk male youth to scare them away from criminal behavior."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George," Okay, I can do that. Uh, I'm gonna need some big blown up photos of your mother."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," They're talking about your time in prison, Dad."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George," Oh, okay. Why not? I mean, uh, if I don't win this thing, I'm gonna be back there anyway."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Buster," ""At Risk Male Youth."" That spells ""Army."""
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, And that's when Buster discovered a recruiting pool the government had been fishing for years.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Buster," I may head down there, too."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," I don't know, Dad, Startled Straight? I'm not sure you're the guy for that, but I'll look into it while I'm down at the fair signing up for a triathlon."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George, Triathlon? Do you know how hard a triathlon is? People lose control of every bodily function. Didn't you ever see that video? It's like your mother on New Year's Eve.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," Actually, Lucille went down faster."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George, You're not even in shape! You're gonna fall apart in front of everybody.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," You're kind of scaring me, Dad."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George, You see? Perfect for this Startled Straight thing.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, Tobias was getting Ann ready for the talent portion of the pageant.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Tobias, I think we need something with a little more spectacle in the act. Something that will make you look small and pretty in comparison. A camel.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael," You know, she has a really lovely singing voice."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Ann, I'll sing to the camel.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Tobias," Yes, we can Google some disco songs with the word ""hump"" in them."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Ann, Cute.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael," No, that sounds a bit racy."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Tobias," Okay. He may be afraid of sex, but you're not going to win without it."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael," No, I'm not afraid of sex..."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Tobias," Oh, good. Have sex with this girl right now. Do it, go. Get in there. Have some sex with her right now. I didn't think so. Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Ann," Give us some room, George Michael, I can't breathe."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Tobias," Okay, now you're upsetting the talent. Out! Get out!"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," Michael, meanwhile, had begun training for the triathlon to keep from humiliating himself in front of Rita."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt," Don't ask ""can I?"" Ask ""I can!"" You can control your bladder when you're dead. No blood, no oil! There's no ""I"" in ""win."""
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," Michael returned confident in his manliness, when he ran into his son, who was questioning his own."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Hey, how is that pageant going?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael, Well... turns out Ann doesn't want me around during it.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, Really?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael," Hey, now you and me can go to that fair together tomorrow, after all."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, Yeah?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael," Yeah, do some man stuff."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Hey, actually, I have already signed up for the father-son triathlon."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael," Oh, okay, great, yeah, I did want to do that with you."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," I mean, I've already promised Steve Holt. I thought he was older, and... more manly."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael, You don't think I'm manly?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," No, no, it's just, uh... Darn that Annabelle, she ruins everything!"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," But the next morning, Michael awoke to discover every muscle in his body was exacting revenge."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, Ow.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," And so was his brother, G.O.B."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Hey, does anyone know why my handlebars are in my bed?!"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, The Church and State Fair was in full swing.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Hope, (Singing.) The Lord has a place / but my body wants to go / all state on you / The Lord has a place / but my body wants to go / all state on you.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, And Lindsay watched with pride as Hope Loblaw did an original number that Lindsay herself had written.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Hope, (Singing.) / All state... on you. /
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Rev. Rob Patterson," And now, please welcome Annabelle Veal, performing ""We Three Kings"" with a camel tow."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Ann, / We three kings... /
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," Michael arrived at the fair, sore from over-training."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Can't really go that high. I'm in a lot of pain, here."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt," Yeah, you know, I figured you'd be that way, so, uh- Coach gave me these. They're, uh, pills filled with oxygen."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, Yeah?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt," They keep you from being incontinent. Have one, they're called Oxy-Incontinent."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, Steve didn't have that quite right.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," But Michael thought Rita might be coming, and he was desperate to impress her. Meanwhile, Maeby was trying to get knocked out of the pageant."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Pope Impersonator," Pope Impersonator, Church. How has God influenced your life?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Maeby, About just as much as Big Bird and the Keebler elves.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Pope Impersonator," Well, my faith would've been shaken if He had taken my legs, too."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B.," G.O.B. Bluth. State. I was betrayed by my brother, Michael! Who's your favorite family member, and why?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Maeby," Definitely not my shallow, materialistic mother, who only cares about looks."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B.," I think we all feel that way about our mothers, and we all have legs."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," Meanwhile, George, Sr. arrived at the Startled Straight tent."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Buster," I'll be waiting out here with my enlistment forms, so go in there and scare them right into my open arm!"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," But as it turns out, the fair had two Startled Straight tents. And George, Sr. had wandered into the church-sponsored one..."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George, Do you want to become some guy's girlfriend?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, ...intended to scare gay young men into a heterosexual lifestyle.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George," You want to have some guy reach around you in the middle of the night, start messing with your junk?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Boy #1, Is he ugly?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George," No, it's pitch black. You don't see him, and it never stops, guys. And everybody acts like it's no big deal."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Boy #2, Is there a cover charge?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, And the Inner Beauty Pageant was down to the final three.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Moderator, Will it be the beautiful Hope Loblaw? The stalwart Annabelle Veal? Or the justifiably-bitter Surely Woolfbeak?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, It became clear that Surely was going to win.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, And that's when Maeby displayed some real inner beauty.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Man in Audience, She can stand! The Lord's blessed her!
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B., Let us pray.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," And Michael, now feeling a little woozy, arrived to see the triathlon course, which consisted of several tricycles, five inflatable pools..."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, ...and fathers and sons being manacled together.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt, Don't let it psyche you out. Did that Oxy-Incontinent set in yet?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt," Kind of... I mean, they change it every year, so you can't replicate it on your lawn, but..."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt, I just thought you wanted to hang out and do guy stuff.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt," I don't know why I thought you'd want to do this. It's stupid, huh?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt, You'll do it with me?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt, Let's win this thing!
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, What the hell!
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt, What the hell!
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Come on, let's go ahead and start up."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," And, after the pageant, George Michael went to congratulate Ann."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael," Well, congratulations on coming in third. That's amazing. And I heard you're the first camel act to ever crack the top ten, too, so that's like a record. And I'm a bit relieved, because, um... I was... I thought maybe if you came in first you would have outgrown me."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Ann, Outgrown you. That is the term I've been looking for.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, It seems G.O.B. was right about what happens to third-place contestants.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Ann, I met a man.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, George Michael was devastated. It seemed he'd lost his girl and his father because he wasn't man enough. And he was faced with a choice.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," Michael and Steve Holt finished their triathlon in first place. Of course, they were way older."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Believe it or not, that took about everything I've got. I don't know what was in that pill, but I do not feel great."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt, Gonna get a little worse before it gets better.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, Really?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt, But we won!
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, Okay.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt," Oh, hey."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Buster," Michael, your son's signing up for the Army."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, What? You signed him up for the Army?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Buster," You're right, if he goes in, I get out. I've got to get my name on his form."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Hang on, hey! I got to get there; I got to stop this! Do this with me!"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, Wait for me!
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Rita, Michael.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, Hey.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Rita, Could you not finish?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," No, first place! First place, I swear, but I'm sorry, I got to go do something- wait, I'm dizzy."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt," Uncle Mike, come on. I'll take you."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," No, no, Steve Steve, Steve!"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt," Hiya. No, let's go, come on. Come on, let's go."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," And, meanwhile, George, Sr. hadn't succeeded in startling anyone but himself."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George," I mean, there's nothing to do all day except lift weights, and fold laundry, get thrown into a cage with a bunch of sweaty men. Excuse me. I can't go back, I can't go back!"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Teen Boy #1," Well, I'm glad he won't be there."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George," No, no, no, no, no. Come on! I can't go back."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, And Michael caught up with George Michael...
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, What are you doing?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, ..who was three rungs away from being in the Army.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael," I'm becoming a man, Dad. Isn't that what everybody wants?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Of course not- G.O.B., can you get us out of these chains, please?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, He's a magician.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Buster, I need you to sign this form.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael," No, it's good, Dad. There's all sorts of benefits, and it's like a family... but it's also an army of one. And it's no place for wimps."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," George Michael, you have a family, okay, and I'm the wimp, not you... because I could not take you being away in the Army. All right? I love you."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B., (Retches out key.) That did it.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, He's not signing up.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Sergeant, That's too bad. I was this close to getting out.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael, I think I'm gonna go get one of those corn dog crosses.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," With all the ""crucifixins""?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George Michael," Right. Thanks, Dad."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Rita, Was that your son?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael," Yes, Rita, yeah. Most important person in the world to me."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Rita," You really are quite a man, Michael."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Michael, Do you really think so?
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Rita," Oh, yes. You're a complete and utter bleep."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator, I can't believe we had to bleep that. It would have been such a nice moment.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, Buster signs up Steve Holt up for the Army, ..."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B.," No, you can't, you can't! I'm finally ready to be a father to you. I know that now."
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Steve Holt, I don't go in for another two years.
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,G.O.B.," Well, as your father, can't I sign something?"
3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,Narrator," ... and George, Sr. finds out that a fake Popemobile ..."

3,Notapusy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Notapusy,George, Thank God I wasn't in the Humvee.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," Michael had snuck out of work to see a British film with his British girlfriend, Rita..."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, I hate it when they hire Yanks to play Brits. You can always tell.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, ...when they came upon a toy store.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, (Gasps.) We should get George Michael one of these.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Oh, no, that's not really him. Besides, I already got him his big present for his birthday."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George Michael," A suit! Dad, it's a Jack Welch!"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, I want you to look under the pants.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George Michael," Quicken! Premier! Dad, I hope you kept the receipt."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, You want to return that?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George Michael," What? No, I want to deduct it."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita," Oh, come on, let's get him the train."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," It's... really, he would only like it for the receipt. And this is crazy, I, really... I can't be seeing movies in the afternoon and then go into toy stores. I have to work. I'm not even supposed to be here."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, Michael couldn't tear himself away. Could you?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, I can't promise it'll be fun.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, (Screaming giddily.)
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Okay... that was fun. Still, the land probably shouldn't have given out underneath us. But we've got a mole problem."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, A mole problem?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Yeah, they've undermined this whole hill, and we probably won't be able to build on it for a few months. But it's my own fault- this is exactly why I should have been coming to work. The Japanese backers, if they find out about this, that we haven't started building, they might not come through with their investments."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, I won't tattle. I really fancy you.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," I fancy you, too."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, Michael was falling for Rita.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, Whoo!
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," And Rita was falling for Michael, too. But that wasn't part of the plan."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Trevor, Rita. You've dirt on your face.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, It's from school.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Trevor," I called the school, and you weren't there. You know, we're here to learn things, not to fall in love."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita," Well, so what if I have. I've got feelings, all right? I'm a woman, too, Not some robot you get to tell everything to! I'm sick of it! I'm sick of it all! Your instructions! And your letters! And your little missions! And stupid assignments- ""You do the math, Rita."" Well, no, you do the math! (Softly.) Oh, God."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Trevor, Do you remember this? And the pledge that you made when you were promised it?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, I said I'd do anything for it.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, I'm a big girl. (Shrieks.) (Laughing.)
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, And Michael returned home as well.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Hey, what happened to you?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias," Oh, I got highlights. It'll blend in in about a week."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Yeah, I actually meant the collapse."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias," Oh, I don't know. It probably has something to do with the 4,000 hair plugs I had in one sitting."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias," Yeah, but he's too busy going to the gym to see his friend, Frank."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias," Oh, we're more than friends. I'm kind of his spotter."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias," You missed a spot. Anyway, we should be looking at some big yen coming in from the Japanese. And when it does, I'm taking my gym buddy out to dinner- I barely even know you! Who's Frank?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Frank," Well, I've been wanting to talk to you about that, but it's a little awkward."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias," Oh, well... I've been wanting to have my own awkward talk as well."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Frank, I think we can be more than just gym buddies.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias," You're blowing my mind, Frank."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Frank," I'm an agent, and I'd like to work with you."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias," Oh. Oh... Well, this is great news, okay, good. I'm so glad you went first. What agency are you with?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," Frank said ""CIA,"" a government agency that was responsible for this catastrophe. But Tobias thought he said ""CAA,"" a talent agency which was responsible for this one."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias," Frank's in the business, Michael. He's got a big project for me. Says it's ""top secret."" He kind of looks like you. Same size. Same curly hair."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Well, Tobias, maybe you should spend less time focused on your looks and a little bit more time focused on your daughter, okay? Her grades are terrible. She's going to start getting ""F's."""
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Maeby, We turn it into a ride.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Mort Meyers, A ride?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Maeby," On the Studio Tour. What used to be the ""Hell Tunnel,"" now becomes... the ""Tunnel of Love, Indubitably."""
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Mort Meyers, But didn't some people die in Hell Tunnel?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Maeby, That is an urban legend. Two elderly people got badly scalded when they tried to climb into the lava cauldron. But I've got that covered.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Mort Meyers, They're just like the poster!
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Grades like those, she's going to be taking tickets at a movie theater the rest of her life."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Lindsay," You know, you're one to talk. You've completely ignored this family since that British bird flew into your life."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," No, I haven't. Well... maybe a little. But, you, know, she's amazing. You know she was in the Olympics?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, She wasn't.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Lindsay, She's that Rita Leeds? Wasn't she on the cover of Newsweek?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, No
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, Yes.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, Michael was thinking of this man.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," She even plays the banjo. Although, I do have to spend more time at work. I was at the property the Japanese funded today, and the whole backside has moles."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias," Yeah, that's Frank's problem, too."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry," Well, look who's finally gracing us with his presence."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, What's a surrogate doing here?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry, We're meeting with the lawyers...
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George, So I've hired this guy to be my eyes and ears.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," You know, Dad, this guy costs us a fortune."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry, He's worth every penny.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George," Hey, I didn't say that."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Bob Loblaw," Oh, Michael!"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, Mr. Loblaw.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Bob Loblaw, I'll catch you up. The Japanese are coming.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, They are?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Bob Loblaw, Somebody tipped them off that the property wasn't ready for building.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Lucille, Which it would have been if Michael hadn't been so busy with his... English muffin.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B., Typical.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Buster, Delicious.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Lucille, I need a drink.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Buster, I'll take an English muffin.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," We'll just have to be honest with these Japanese investors. They, uh, come from a culture that values honor and respect."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B., And Godzilla! (Roars like Godzilla.)
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Buster, Gojira! (Roaring.)
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George, Gojira! (Roaring.)
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry, Roar.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, This needs to stop now. This is exactly what we shouldn't do when they show up.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Lucille, (Growling.)
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Mom, that's enough."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Lucille, What? We're out of vodka.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, Sorry. Thought you were doing Godzilla.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Lucille, (Roars.)
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Mom, that's enough."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Lucille, What- I'm laughing.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B., build a miniature city. Put it outside the window. Tell them it's far away. It'll look real if you squint.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B., God knows they're squinters.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B.," What do you think, Dad? A whole... tiny town?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry," Another brilliant idea, Einstein."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B., Really? You'd like to build it with me?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George, Larry really never knows how to sell the sarcasm.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry, It's a stupid idea.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Buster," Uh... I'll build it with you, G.O.B."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B.," Oh, great. That's another brilliant idea, Steinberg."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Bob Loblaw," I agree with Michael. If you take money from these people under false pretenses, you'll be committing fraud. The government's already watching your father pretty closely. They're going through his mail. They want to put your father in prison for good."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George," Yeah, Bob's right. We've got to start thinking practically. Life is not some cheesy Japanese movie where the hero pulls on a pair of jet pants."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry, And flies off the balcony like Astro Boy.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George, Even better.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Bob Loblaw, And you need to find that leak and plug it. Your father said that he was set up by a British syndicate. Maybe you should look for somebody English.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, What?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Lucille, I think Michael's already plugged our leak.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, What is that supposed to mean?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B.," You've been spending a lot of time with Rita, and she's British-ish."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Buster, She's a spy!
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, I haven't told Rita anything.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, This was not strictly true.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Let's start with my family's misdemeanors, and then we're going to push right on through to the lighter treasons."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," The Japanese backers, if they find out about this, that we haven't started building, they might not come through with their investments."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Then he siphoned off the entire pension fund into a dummy corporation, filed for bankruptcy and used... Do you know any other songs?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Buster, She's a spy!
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Rita is not a spy, okay? She's a beautiful, elegant woman. It doesn't make sense."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B., What doesn't make any sense is why she's dating you.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Bob Loblaw," No, that's a good point."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Bob Loblaw," Actually my sources tell me that the leak goes by the name ""Mr. F."""
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Ah. ""Mr. F."" Rita's not a man."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Lucille, And it could be an alias.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Buster, Alias is a show about a spy!
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," All right, that's it. I finally find someone that I really care about, my family tries to drive us apart. It's not going to work. So, you know what? I got a switch for you- you guys handle this problem, I am going to go have some fun."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry, Unbelievable. Deserting the family when we most need him. Shameful.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George," G.O.B., I'm sending you a package. You'll know what to do with it."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," Michael was upset, and he called Rita."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, Hello?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Hey. I've been thinking. I'm going to start working less, and I do want to start having more fun. So, I'd like to take you out tomorrow. All day, anywhere you want. What do you say?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,John Beard," ""Hell Tunnel"" takes another name. Will it take another life?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita," Oh, I say yes. Only I'm going to take you out."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," The next morning, Michael was heading out for his day with Rita."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," George Michael. I love my present, Dad. I'd wear it to school, but who needs a ""Welch wedge,"" right? That's when they... Enough business. In fact, I got you another present. It's something I saw yesterday when I was out with Rita. It's time for us to start having some fun."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George Michael," I don't know... ""Fun"" and ""Failure"" both start out the same way."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Well, let's just go ahead and rip this down."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, And Larry the surrogate showed up to pick up the jet that George Sr. had sent to the model home.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry," What is that, a train set? Look down, Larry."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George," No, not down at your feet."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry," Left. My left, your right."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George," What is the matter with this guy? And, let me guess, he's probably..."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry," Saying all that, too."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George, It is a train set. Those Japanese sites. I'm never going to find my way...
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry, Past that hallway sensor.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B.," Dad, what are you doing here? Is this the package you sent me? Tiny town! This is for tiny town, isn't it! You did like my idea, didn't you, Dad?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry, I think he's in the can.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," Actually, George Sr. was in the kitchen trying to soothe himself with an ice cream sandwich."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Buster," If mother sees this, she will blow a cow."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George, Uh-oh.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Buster," Dad. Oh, cool, a train set."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry," Oh, I've always wanted one of those."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B., Maybe we could build our tiny town together. Do you want to?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, Buster had always wanted to do the same with G.O.B.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Buster," Goody, yeah. I do want to."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry," Yay, I do want to. Goody."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," G.O.B. was thrilled, as was Buster. Only Larry was disappointed. But he was such a pro, you'd never know it. And back at the gym, Tobias was finding out more about the project the agent had suggested."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias," Come on, what are you gonna tell me? What do you got for me?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Frank, The Japanese investors you told us about are going over to your place today. I need you there when they are. We need you to be a mole.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias," Oh, kind of a backer's audition. Okay, I get it, all right. Well, then, Frank, I shall be a bigger, hairier mole than the one on your inner left thigh."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," And later, Michael and Rita were on the Tantamount Studios tour."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Frankie Muniz, (...he doesn't understand about bovine spongiform encephalitis...)
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tour Guide," Hold, hold! Tram! Let's get out of here, folks! Make some room!"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita," Look, it's Malcolm in the Middle."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," In the middle of shooting, I guess."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Frankie Muniz," Oh, that's okay. It's more important to show how we make the show than to actually make it. bleep Tantamount."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, Hello?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George Michael," Hey, Dad, they just dropped off the package you sent, but I don't think I'm old enough."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, Of course you are. I told you I want you to have a little fun. You're not gonna break anything.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," But of course, Michael thought was talking about the train set. Not the extremely dangerous jet pack the boy had just found at the front door."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George Michael," Well, what if I crash it?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, That's half the fun.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," And soon the tour arrived at the Tunnel of Love, Indubitably..."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tour Guide," So take the hand of someone you love as we enter the Tunnel of Love, Indubitably- Tunnel of Hell!"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, ...which still had some bugs to work out. But Michael was happy to hold the hand of someone he now realized he did love. And then he noticed her bracelet.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, Michael had just noticed that Rita was wearing a suspicious bracelet.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, What does your bracelet say?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita," (Laughs.) Nothing. Oh, look, look! There they are on the bicycle made for two."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Says Mr. F, doesn't it? Who is he?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita," Nobody... I can't tell you! Oh, God. He followed us."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, Wait a minute. You know that man?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, It's not what you think it is. He's my uncle.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, Is that Mr. F? What does he want?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, He wants you out of the picture.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Trevor," Bloody right, I do!"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Hey, hey! You lied to me, Rita. You made me turn against my family, but it's over now."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Trevor, Oh! Me bleeps are wet.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, (Softly.) Michael.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, And Maeby received a call about the latest lava cauldron accident.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Maeby, Already? It's only been an hour. I'm going to lose this job. Maybe I should let Mort take me out to dinner.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, Maeby!
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Maeby," Okay, I'm definitely gonna lose this job- I can explain."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Rita set me up, set us all up. This beautiful, funny, brilliant woman was a spy. Everybody was right, it was too good to be true! And I am turning her in. Let me tell you something else. I would not want to be the next woman who tries to fool me."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Maeby," Well, that was a freebie."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," George Michael, meanwhile, was trying to solve a mystery of his own. The jet pack had come with an instructional DVD that seemed to confuse more than clarify. What was clear was that the gift was extremely dangerous."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, And it did seem like a lot of work... for a little pay off.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Japanese Hostess, Have fun!
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," Meanwhile, G.O.B. was bonding with the man he thought his father was controlling."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B., Almost done with the water tower.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry, Neat-o.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," His real father, however, had actually gotten lost within the walls."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George, Where the hell am I?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, He was actually somewhere between the linen closet and the guest room
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B.," You know, I'm really glad that we're doing this together. I've never felt so close to you."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Buster," Oh, I feel the same way."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry, He's crying now.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B.," God, look at us. We're like a couple of girls on the last day of camp!"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Frank, You ready?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias," Oh, yes, I'm going to be a great mole. Check, two, three. Let Lily lick Lionels lusty leathers..."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Jay #2, The levels are fine.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Frank," Remember, no one can know it's you. We need to capture George Sr."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias, Capture George Sr.? Is that what you hired me to do?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Frank, You didn't realize that?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias, No. But it does make perfect sense. I have played him before.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias," It's gonna be tough to work that into the character, and it's going to fight the costume I rented, but I didn't take six weeks of improv classes at the Groundlings for nothing. (Chuckles.)"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, And Michael was on the phone to Bob Loblaw.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," I don't even think she's here legally, all right? She's taken advantage of me. I want you to take care of this. Call the CIA, do whatever you have to do."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Bob Loblaw," Fine, but you take care of your family. I think they're going ahead with this hoax. And if money changes hands, you're all going to jail."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B.," Unfortunately the roads are out, so we can't take you up there to see it in person, but if you stand absolutely still right there, and just squint into the light and behold ""Sudden Hill!"""
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," G.O.B., don't!"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," It actually looked pretty good. Even the financiers thought so. Ishiro said, ""I am reassured."" and ""They treat us with respect this time."" Motoyoshi said, ""I thought the woman was pretending as a monster, but she was just out of vodka."""
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, Let's go ahead and close the curtains and not accept any money while we're ahead.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B.," So as you can see, any rumor of a mole problem is completely untrue."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," But unfortunately, this was just as Tobias appeared..."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias, Oh... I'm a mole.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, ...in his rented mole outfit.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B., No! The village!
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias, Families should come- ow! Ow! I'm very particular about building codes. And this water tower does not pass muster.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry, Who can save our village?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," As it turns out, it was George Michael, who had finally got his grandfather's jet pack to work."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George Michael," Okay, now... I'm supposed to press... He keeps getting in my way. I can't stop this thing."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias, You're blowing my audition!
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, I ache with embarrassment. The Japanese were never to be heard from again.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," All right, what's going on here? Okay, that's no surprise. George Michael?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George Michael," Dad, I'm sorry, I can't fly it very well. I think I really would rather have the Welch."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," I didn't buy you that. I bought you the train set, which you guys just destroyed."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George Michael, Did you keep the receipt?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, What is that?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry, Feedback. Is someone else wired?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias," Oh, that's me. My friend Frank wired me. He wanted me to be a mole."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Frank, Our cover's blown!
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Jay #2, Let's get out of here.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Frank," Good-bye, Tobias."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, He wanted you to be a mole?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Oh, my God. Tobias Fünke. You're Mr. F. Which means that man was Rita's uncle- what have I done?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Tobias, I have to get this suit back.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B.," They destroyed our town, but they can't take away our memories?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Buster," Oh, I've had... The time of my life."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Lucille," I think he's being sarcastic, G.O.B."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Buster," No, I'm not, Mother. I mean lover."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Larry, I like making love to Mother.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Buster, I mean lover!
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B.," Oh, my God, Buster, is that you?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Buster," Yes. G.O.B., it's just I wanted to spend some time with you. That's all. And you enjoyed it, you can't deny that."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B., I guess you're right. Maybe we should spend more time together.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Buster, Oh. I'd really like that.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,G.O.B., It's weird. It took some idiot parrot man with a camera in his hat to bring us together.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, But even a pro like Larry has a breaking point.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, Rita.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, What do you want? I have to pack.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, Pack? Where are you going?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, Someone called the bobbies on us.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Oh, no."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, My uncle and I have to go back to big Britain.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Oh, that was me, Rita. I'm so, so sorry. I didn't know what was going on. Why did your uncle threaten me?"
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, He thought you might be trouble.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, That was actually very astute of him.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita," Good-bye, Michael. You know, I really did fancy you. I can't stay here now."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, Marry me!
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, What?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael," Let me marry xou. You can get a green card, stay here, and we can see if this works. I know it sounds crazy, but... This will give us a chance to get away from both of our families and see if this works. Might be fun."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita, Yes.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, Really?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita," Yes. Yes. Yes, yes! But let's go right now. Before my uncle gets out of the shower for some more cigarettes. You take that. I got to leave a note."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, But there was one piece of intelligence that Michael didn't have.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Jay #2, Interesting.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Frank," Don't even think about it, Jay. She's an MRF."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Jay #2, MRF? What's that?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Frank, Mentally Retarded Female.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Jay #2, That explains what she's doing with him.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Frank, And the hats.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Trevor," Oh, my God. She's gonna marry him."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, George, Sr., disoriented in the walls, almost makes contact with a new mole..."
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,George, (Screams.)
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, Not that one. Wait for it...
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Narrator, ... and Michael and Rita start a new life together.
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Michael, What's that?
3,Mr. F,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Mr._F,Rita," A prize. A lovely, lovely prize."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, Michael was sharing some very important news with his parents.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, I am getting married.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George, Who the hell to?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Who do you think? Rita.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, Her?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George, Why?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Well, first of all, she needs a green card to stay in the country."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, There it is.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," She needs a green card to stay in the country, because, secondly... we're really crazy about each other."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, You hardly know her.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," I know all the important stuff. She was in the Olympics. She's sweet, she's smart, she's beautiful, she's special."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, She was special.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Are houses terribly hard to make?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Actually, the hardest part is finding the land."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, But she wasn't smart.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Instead of making houses, maybe you should make land."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, For Rita had only mentally progressed...
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, On the ocean.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, ...to the level of a first grader.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, There's no land on the ocean.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, Michael might have noticed her disability if it had not been masked by her English accent.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, You're brilliant.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, Yeah... She wasn't.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," I know she's a really, really good person, and everything else is going to be little surprises along the way."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, With the exception of that one big one.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, The wedding? Is in one month.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Buster, Oh.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, A month?!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George," All right, now look, just because a woman gets pregnant doesn't mean you have to marry her. Too many lives have been ruined because some cheap waitress at a HoJo said she used an IUD."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, It was Stuckey's.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George, But I believed you.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," She's not pregnant- truthfully, we haven't even slept together."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, This is funny!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Buster, He's gay!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, Where's your hand?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Buster," Oh. I'm having my high school ring put on it, and my hook is stuck in the staircar."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Buster," (Singing with song.) / Domo arigato, Mister Roboto... /"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Buster, Oh...
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George, Do you think getting married will solve your sex problem?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, No. And... we don't have a problem. We just haven't had the right opportunity yet.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Buster, Lindsay said Rita slept over last night.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Yes. But I gave her the bedroom because I didn't want her to feel pressured.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator," Actually, it was Michael who felt a little pressured."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, And I like to keep the light on. That way I can see if you have a monster. Night-night. Can you shut the door on your way out?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, I can't believe you're not supporting this.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George, Because it is obvious what she's after.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, Our money.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Buster," Oh, God, our money!"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Let's just all relax, and remind ourselves that we don't have any money."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Buster, She's already gotten our money!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Let's not forget she's the one that gave us the idea for that ocean-top town called ""Bluthton."""
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George," Oh, big deal, I had that same basic idea years ago."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," I thought you'd be happy, and I should have known better."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille," Michael, be careful. People just see what they want to see. If she loved you, she'd show it."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator," Michael was worried- his mother may have been making sense. So, he returned home to talk to Rita."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Tobias," Ah, here comes the bride."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Hey. What are you doing in a wheelchair?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Tobias," No, no, no, it's a dolly to help videotape your nuptials."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, I don't think I need any footage of my nuptials.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Tobias, are you sure that this dolly isn't related to your recent health problems?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Tobias," Okay, so my legs and my left arm occasionally ""go to sleep,"" and you want to call it a health problem. Oop! (Groans.)"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Hey, hey, hey, hey."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Tobias," No, I can get up myself. (Straining.) Ah! Here we go. Let me get in the dolly. No, thank you, I don't need your help."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, It does seem like you've been having a whole lot of trouble since the hair transplants. Maybe you should see a boo-boo-man.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Tobias," A... ""bubuman""?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Oh, uh, a doctor. It's a British expression. Like they say ""go-up box"" instead of ""elevator."""
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Tobias," Oh, like when they say ""poofter"" to mean ""tourist,"" yes. Boy, that Rita's a smarty."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," True, but it's not like anybody appreciates it. Mom and Dad do not like Rita."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Maeby, Are they crazy? She's amazing. I saw her last night and she helped with this little project I was doing.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, Maeby was struggling with a screenplay in her secret life as a film executive.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Is that a story?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Maeby," Not yet. It doesn't have an ending. He's in L.A., she's in Japan. How do I get these two characters together?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Maybe they could walk.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Maeby, Across the ocean?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, If it's not too deep.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Maeby," No, deep is good. People are going to say, ""What the hell just happened? I better say I like it."" 'Cause nobody wants to seem stupid."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, And Michael caught up with his brother.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Pal, I need a favor. As you know, I'm getting married in about a month..."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B., Say no more.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Great. Are you sure that you know what...
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B.," Yup, yup, yup. Got it."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Super. And-and, just so that we're both clear..."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B., You want me to do a magic show at the wedding. I'm on it.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, So glad we pushed through that. No magic.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B.," Why, because the one little screw up last time?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Man, Put her out! Put her out!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Man #2," Tracy! Tracy! Roll, honey!"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Woman, Thank God we already did the pictures.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B., Which reminds me that Rita shouldn't wear any hairspray at this thing.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, I just want you to be my witness.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B.," Oh, you want me to... be your Best Man?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, It's just a signature I need. On the license. My son's not old enough. It's no big deal.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B., I will not take this sacred duty lightly. I am going to get you the single healthiest call girl that this town has ever seen.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," This is why I'm calling it a ""Witness,"" and not a ""Best Man."" Look, all you have to do is watch."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B.," Oh, I'm not going to spend this kind of money and not watch."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B., (Spanks Michael.)
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, This may have been a bad choice.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Hey, hello. Well, look at you two, Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dum."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator," Michael didn't mean it in that way. How could he, he didn't even know."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lindsay, We had the best time! She's got such an amazing fashion sense.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, You guys have these jackets on inside out?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Yeah, that way you see the label."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lindsay," Yeah, I mean, that's what you're paying for, right? It's a great statement on fashion."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Plus, it doesn't tickle your neck."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, Michael took Lindsay aside to share his concerns.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," So, Lindsay, when did you first realize that you and Tobias had no chance at a physical relationship?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lindsay," Oh, my God, do you think we have no chance at physical relationship?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Just now.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Um, see, Rita and I have not been physical yet, and... You don't think that she's doing this just for a green card, do you?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lindsay," No. No, she's not that kind of person. No, you just haven't been alone with her. Ask her to stay over at a hotel with you tonight. She's going to know what that means."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, That is not a bad idea. Don't... don't do that.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, And G.O.B. began to prepare a magic trick for Michael's wedding.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B., King... takes his queen... and showers her with diamonds! Clubs. Club sauce. He covers her with club sauce. Right that'll be my line if that happens.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Is that a magic trick? I love magic.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B., I don't appreciate the dry British humor.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Please do a magic trick for me.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B.," Well, I shouldn't... I'd hate to be blamed for setting another one of Michael's brides... on fire!"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Oh, lighter fluid like Uncle Trevor uses! But wherever did it come from?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B.," Okay, I've got to get you into an illusion at the wedding. How long can you hold your breath?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Oh, long. One time, 20 minutes."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator," Actually, her record was 20 seconds."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B.," You can stop it. Okay I'll take your word for it. Now, I just need to find a trick that puts you out of oxygen for 20 minutes."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Sorry, did I hear the word ""trick""? And it smells a lot like lighter fluid in here. You know, I did say no tricks, G.O.B., and I mean it."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B., What if I find a trick that has her float to the alter or something?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," No, no. Love for her to walk. And not to drown. Or fly through the air. Or catch on fire."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B., Is she allergic to cat fur?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Oop- no tigers.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B., Right.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," So, uh, Rita, um... I was wondering if maybe you and I might head down to a hotel. Maybe some alone time."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Oh, yes."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Yeah?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Maybe our rooms could touch.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Well, I-I-I was hoping maybe for more than just our rooms to touch. I was... thinking maybe we could be... in the same room. Be in the same bed."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Oh, I see what you mean, a real sleepover."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Well, maybe."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Okay.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Really?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Well, maybe I should go home and get my things. I do kind of miss my jammies."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, I think they're going to have a lot of that stuff there.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, And my tiny teddy.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Good. Yes, get that."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, And so George Michael drove Rita to Wee Britain.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, It's nice to be with some so young. We can listen to young people's music for a change.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George Michael," Great, yeah, please."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Man," (/ Hot potato, hot potato / /Hot po-ta-to... / /Hot ""potat-o"" /.)"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," /Hot potat-o, hot potat-o... /"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, That's when he first grew concerned. And Rita packed for the sleepover.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor," Do you have any idea what a ""sleepover"" is? Cause it's not just sleep."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," I know what it is, Trevor, I've seen your secret magazine. I want to have grown-up fun. Spoon and figgy pudding. Rabbitown dum druggary's hollow. And I want to have pop-pop."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor," Well, the very fact that you call it that, tells me you're not ready. Oh, and for your information, that's a cricket magazine. Whether you like it or not, you're still a child in many ways. I've got a problem with you having sexual relations with that man."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, So do I.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor," I mean, it's not your fault your parents were cousins, but... here we are. Now, I've been charged with taking care of you, and I'm bloody well going to do it!"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Well, Michael will be my cousin soon enough, cause we're getting married."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor, Married?!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Married!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor, Totally out of the question!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, (Singsong) Married! Married! Married!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor," All right, that does it. You're not going anywhere. I'm putting the invisible locks on the door."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, That's not fair.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor, Lock. Lock. Lock.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, That's not fair! It's just not fair!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor, Lock. Lock. I've got to find a new hiding place for that magazine.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, And Michael was waiting at the hotel.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Hey, Dad. Just wanted to let you know that I'm at a hotel with my wife-to-be. And we're very, very much in love."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,"George, Sr.", Put her on.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, Michael briefly considered faking the voice.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, (falsetto) I...
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, She's in the shower.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,"George, Sr.", I'll wait.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Let's wait.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Don't you want me to just call you back or...
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,"George, Sr.", No. I got nowhere to go. I'm under house arrest. Let's watch something together.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,"George, Sr."," Wow. That Blossom grew up, huh? Say, how's that shower comin'?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," All right, look, she's not in the shower."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,"George, Sr.", Really?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," She said that she'd meet me at the hotel. I called you a little prematurely, but she is coming."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,"George, Sr.", Really?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,"George, Sr."," Uh! Hey, put Rita on."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, That's when Michael finally accepted that Rita wasn't coming... and that local calls were 2.95 a minute.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Come on!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, That's where they get you.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, Michael drove to Wee Britain to call off the wedding that he now realized was not based on love.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Who is it?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," It's Michael, Rita. Can I come in?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, I can't let you in.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, You didn't show up last night. The least you can do is talk to me face-to-face.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, I can't. Trevor locked the door. He doesn't want me to be with you.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, What? He locked the door? You can't unlock this door?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, I can't even see half the locks.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Rita? What?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, They're invisible. Trevor's the only one who can see them.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, I've got an idea. Go next to the window. I'm gonna climb up.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Be careful.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, I will.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator," And so Michael set about rescuing the beautiful, sweet, mentally challenged woman he'd fallen in love with... without realizing she was mentally challenged."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Yea, Michael! Yea!"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor, Who undid the locks?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Come on out.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Trevor's back.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Come on. Hop on.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, What?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Hop on.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Huh? Huh?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Ready?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Oh! Oh! Whee! Oh!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor, Hey! Stop that. Both of you come back!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, You can't stop us!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Nothing can stop us now. Nothing in the world of man nor beast, nor time is..."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George," (On phone.) Well, God help her if she tries to rename Bluthton. I'll sink it first. I swear, I'll sink the whole damn thing."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George, (To Lucille.) They're going through with it... tomorrow.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, But that's when George and Lucille had a surprise visitor.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor," All right, where the hell is Rita? I'm her uncle."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, Let the hand-outs begin!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor," There's not gonna be any hand-outs, and she is not gonna marry your son."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George," You're against this marriage, too?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor," Well, of course I am. Rita's not capable of making a decision like that. You are not gonna get Rita's millions just because she's mentally challenged."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George, Millions?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, Millions?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Buster, Mentally challenged?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, Shh! It's not polite.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor," She owns all of Wee Britain. And also the Wee Britain in Cleveland. Of course, we're probably gonna lose all that if her ridiculous idea for Sea Britain goes through."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George, We are not after her money.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, And I don't think Michael even knows about her... condition.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor," Yes, it's funny how Americans don't pick up on that. I think it's 'cause of her accent and the plastic surgery she's been able to afford. We wouldn't have this trouble if they'd met last year. I got to put a stop to this. We're gonna search every bloody hotel in town."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille," Oh, Legoland. I think they said they were going to Legoland."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George, They did say Legoland.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Buster, I didn't hear anything about Legoland.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, He doesn't know what he's talking about. We think he may be mentally challenged.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Buster, What?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor, All right then.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George, We have got 24 hours to get them married before Michael figures out what she really is.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, This the first time in two years you've sounded like George Bluth.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Buster, (Groans.)
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator," Later at night, Michael was at the hotel with his bride to be."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Rita, I've been really looking forward to this."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Me, too. I want to have sexual relations."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, That's why I brought this.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, (Laughs.) No.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Why don't you go ahead and whip out that tiny teddy, and then we're gonna think up a fun safe word, okay? (Answers door.) George Michael. I did not know that you were... Um, go ahead and.. talk out here."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," We just got back from the bumpaddle courts. Tomorrow, I'm teaching her baseball."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George Michael, Yeah. That may take a while.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Sorry?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George Michael," Well, listen, Dad, th-this is... hard for... This is hard for me to say this... I was videotaping Rita. Let's just say it would be cute if it was someone much younger."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George Michael, I'm sorry. We really should get another tape.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Mm.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George Michael," I mean, they're not expensive."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George Michael," It's the plastic fruit, dad."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," It's very convincing fruit, okay? Is she going back in for another?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Well, you know, they don't even have bananas in England, okay, son? Now, I know this is hard for you, but it would be nice to be supported in some... Oh, no, she's going into the grapes."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George Michael," Yeah, she really liked those. I'm sorry. I think she might be... retar... retarded. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Say hello to my tiny teddy. (Gasps.) Tiny Teddy! (Gasps.)
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, And that's when it dawned on Michael.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Oh, you teach kids, huh?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Oh, I like to think they teach me."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, That way I can see if you have a monster.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Be careful.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, I've made a huge mistake.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator," Michael had just been shown that his fiancee might be mentally challenged, but he needed proof."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Are you ready for lie-down kisses with me?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Maybe we ought to just talk a little bit, you know? I mean, what the heck. For instance you've never told me how many houses there are in the British Parliament."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Seven.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Are there?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, The answer's three.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Does sound about right.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, Three is the correct answer.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Come on.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Let's have our fun. Rita corny, Michael."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," You know, I think that we should wait until after we're married."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," / Married, married, married! / Okay, night-night."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator," And Michael felt he deserved a $15 thing of candy beans. The next morning, however, as Michael prepared to let Rita down gently, he was met with another surprise."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, Surprise!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, What's this?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, We're throwing you a wedding.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Oh, how lovely!"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Larry, On us. Everything you see.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George," Show them the waffle bar, Larry."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Larry, It's over there.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Yeah, you know, I-I was just gonna talk to Rita about all of this. Rita, I think that we should, um, wait a little while."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, Wait? Why? I don't want to wait. I want to get married and have sexual relations like you promised.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Uh...
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille," Where did you get this firecracker? I... love her, Michael."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Larry, So do I. I want to kiss my new daughter-in-law.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George," Hey, not on our time, Larry."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Larry, Right on the lips.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," No, no, Dad, please take it easy."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, I'm gonna go get my dress from the... From the room.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille," Yes, I'll help you put it on inside out!"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Okay, let's-let's not all get, um... Hey, mom, what-what's going on? I thought that you guys were against all this."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille," Well we figured you know best, and who are we to interfere, and you love this girl, and the rest will just be little happy surprises along the way. Like you said."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Larry," Yeah, with the exception of the retard thing."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George," Oh, God."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Larry, Tell me you didn't just say that.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, You knew?
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," You knew, and yet, you still wanted me to go through with this?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, What can I say? I'm crazy about the little dullard.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Oh, my God. She's rich. This is a new low, even for you, Mom."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lucille, What is wrong with you?!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Larry, Larry go to a mirror!
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George, You're fired.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Larry," You're fired. What?! It's over. And this is how you tell me, in the middle of a wedding? You shouldn't have said anything. You shouldn't have said anything."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," So, you were right. Now what am I gonna do?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George Michael," Well, I've been thinking. You know, I mean, every society has their own rules about this stuff. For instance, in some states, it's legal to marry your own cousin. California's blocked it twice, but that's only because they tacked it onto an estate law thing that wasn't gonna pass. We had the signatures..."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," You're 16, and you know all that. She's 30 and a half. She probably can't list the seven Houses of Parliament."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George Michael, There's three.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Now I got to break her heart.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George Michael," Well, doesn't she have to leave the country if you don't marry her?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Yeah, I guess I can keep my promise about that, huh? There wouldn't be any real intimacy, and-and it would be the strongest marriage in the family, but, you know, as much as I'd like to, you can't ignore the fact that she is mentally disabled."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Lindsay," Oh, my God. I'm wearing an inside out bridesmaid's dress."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,George Michael," You better catch her, Dad."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, That's not gonna be easy. She's an Olympic Silver. Just figured that one out.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Maeby," Hey. Well, I'll have to go stop production on The Ocean Walker."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, You found out.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Took me long enough.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Maybe you're not smart, either. I didn't know until they told me."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," No, I'm just a narcissist who was too self-involved to see the truth."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, That makes no sense to me.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe I'm being too hard on myself."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," You know, the truth is, is that I did just see what I wanted to see, Rita. You're so beautiful, and you're so sweet. And you deserve to find somebody a lot more like you. I don't think that either of us would be happy."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," So, it's bye-bye to Rita, then?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Unless you really want to stay in America.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita, I wanted to be with you.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Trevor," Oy, Rita! Time to go now. Back to England, love."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Oh, Michael, will you come visit me lots?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," That's gonna be difficult, Rita. You're gonna be across an ocean."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Well, you can always walk."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Not on the water.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Rita," Oh, Michael, you're such a grown-up."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael," Hey, hey! Hang on a sec. That's part of your trick, right?"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B.," No. That's not my trick, Michael."
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, On the next Arrested Development...
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,G.O.B., It's my illusion.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Narrator, ... Michael relives a wedding nightmare.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Buster," Oh, put him out, put him out!"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Tobias," My hair, my beautiful hair!"
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Michael, Push him in the pool.
3,The Ocean Walker,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_Ocean_Walker,Tobias," Why am I not going under water? Dear God, why am I not going under water?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator, Michael Bluth paid an unexpected visit to his mother.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," You look pretty, Mom."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lucille, What do you need?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, Need? Why do you think I need something?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lucille," Well, you're too busy for us. No one's seen you. Going on all those dates with Rita. Or should I say... ""play dates."""
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator, Michael had recently dated a woman he later found out was mentally challenged.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," We're not seeing each other any more, but it's for the best. I'm actually kind of relieved it's over."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator," Actually, Michael had been so devastated by their breakup that he'd even broken out the old guitar."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, (sings briefly) I've... / I... /
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,George Michael, Maybe you should talk to someone.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, Like my mom?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,George Michael," I don't know, does she play guitar?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," So, can't a guy call his mom pretty without it seeming strange?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Buster, Amen! And how about that little piece of tail on her? Cu-ute!
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, I've opened a door here that I regret.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lucille," Oh, he's just talking about his stupid turtle."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, Oh.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Buster," She has a name, Mother. And it's ""Mother."""

3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Buster, You can stay in this box that Uncle/Father Oscar left behind.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator," In fact, it was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Buster," Oh, good, you've already got grass."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator, Primo bud. Real sticky weed.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Buster, Although I was getting a little worried because she was moving really slowly last week. And then she stopped. Hmm.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," Yeah, well, in any event, I'm here, Mom, because you need me. As you know, the Bluth Foundation dinner is a week away. I am your co-chair, and we don't want to relive the ""T.B.A."" debacle."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator," Years earlier, the Bluths had a hard time agreeing on a cause for their foundation's first fund-raiser."

3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay," Well, I'll be honest, I haven't heard anything that beats herpes."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator," So they sent out invitations with the disease still ""to be announced"". And, much to their surprise, the Bluths ended up raising over $25,000 to fight ""T.B.A."" And then- a here's the really horrible part- they did it again the following year."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,G.O.B.," Keep fighting, little guy. With your support of the Bluth Foundation, we'll live in a galaxy where ""T.B.A."" does not exist."

3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, The guy who ran Dad's prison?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lucille, He's here now installing cameras because of all your father's escape attempts.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,"George, Sr."," Uh, yeah, looks like I won't be going anywhere for a little while. What do I care, huh? I got a beautiful wife, I got a wonderful hobby. Hah! Look at me, I'm having the time of my life!"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator, His hobby was making papier-mâché copies of his own head.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,"George, Sr."," Oh, before I forget, do you know if these cameras are high def?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," You wrote a screenplay, huh?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Warden Gentiles," I promised myself I wasn't going to become one of those people who were always going on about their screenplays. So, I'll just say I put together a staged reading with some fabulous young actors, and it was very well received."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator, Warden Gentiles had convinced his granddaughter's teacher to mount New Warden as a school play.

3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Boy Gentiles, Beat him with a pillow case full of batteries.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lucille," Ward's letting us hold the event in the new wing of the prison. After lockdown, everyone's going to spend the night in a cell!"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,"George, Sr.", Are they color or black and white?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lucille," So, Michael, I don't need your help at all. Unless you need something from me?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," No, I'm fine. Just thought I could help. Relieved I don't have to."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator," But he wasn't relieved. So, he went home to complain to his sister Lindsay."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," Prison's the last thing we want people associating with the Bluth name. Plus, who's going to want to go?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Maeby," Wait, this is going to be at the prison? Oh, great. Probably going to run into that warden."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, How do you know the warden?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Maeby," Oh, right. Uh, he spoke at my school for a ""Startled Straight"" assembly."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator," Actually, she'd met with him in the hopes of using his prison as a location for a film."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Warden Gentiles, I think you will find the dessert both engrossing and high grossing.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Maeby," So, we don't get dessert?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Maeby, Guess I have some reading to do.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," Besides, I doubt very much Mom's come up with a real disease to have a fund-raiser for."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay," Graft Versus Host. It's new, it's fatal, and guess who's got it?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Doctor Carr," You've heard of bodies rejecting transplants? Well, in this case, your transplanted hair is rejecting your body. Either you remove your hair graft, or the host -you- will get sicker and eventually die."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay, Can you think of any benefits?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Doctor Carr, Benefits? No. He'll die.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay," Oh, yeah, no, I-I get that. But have there ever been any fund-raisers?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay, A husband with the headline disease. Everyone's going to want to talk to me.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, You're making him keep the hair?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay, Did you see the attention Superman's wife got?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay," Besides, Tobias wants it, too."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Tobias," Oh, she's right. This is going to be great for me, because I'm going to star in the video G.O.B.'s making for the gay-la."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,G.O.B.," Oh, yeah, it'll be very uplifting. Oh, here, let me get that for you."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Tobias, Thank you. Oh! Oh! This is going hurt!
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Tobias, Oop.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,G.O.B., You know what? We're going to need this from another angle.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, And you sure you're okay?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Tobias," Oh, probably. I can't feel anything. How's my hair?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," It's fine. It's sucking the life out of you, Tobias. I mean, everything has gone crazy, the gala, Mom and Warden Gentiles. I mean, what is in it for him? I think he's taking advantage of Mom."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay, Did it ever occur to you that maybe Warden Gentiles likes her?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, Likes her what?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay," No, I mean, likes her. Like, is attracted to her."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," Who's the ""her"" in that sentence?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay, Mom. Warden Gentiles likes Mom.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, Her?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Tobias," I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," And if he likes her in that sense, it makes it even worse. I don't want Mom mixed up with the sort of creep that would have her as a fetish."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay," Oh, Michael, you're just feeling neglected by your mother. You wanted to go to this with her, didn't you?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," Hey, I-I don't need to take my mom to a gala, okay? On losers go to those things with their parents, I'm going with my son."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,George Michael," Oh, I may skip that, I don't like galas."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator," Actually, he loved galas, all kids do."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Tobias," Oh, come on, don't leave your Uncle Teabag hanging."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,George Michael, Please don't call yourself that.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator, What he was having trouble with was looking directly at his dying uncle.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, I can't stand by and watch Mom get hurt. I have to get down there.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,G.O.B.," This is heartbreaking. Got to get this for the video. Hey, George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator," Buster, meanwhile, was also feeling abandoned by Mother."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Buster, Mother! I have no one.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator," But at that very moment, his true father returned."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Buster, Uncle/Father Oscar? What are you doing here?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Oscar," Oh, a hug. Nice. You haven't seen a little box with a turtle on it, have you?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Buster," Oh, yeah. My turtle was living in it before he ate all the grass and died."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Oscar, He ate all the grass?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Buster, Yeah.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Oscar," Well, it's been great catching up."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Buster," Wait, wait, wait, where are you going?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Oscar," No, I can't stay, because if my brother finds out that I'm here, he can try switching places again, and I can't go back to prison."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Buster," Wait, wait, wait. If my father comes in, you can hide in one of G.O.B.'s tricks."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Oscar, I can't.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Buster, At least you can stay and help me bury my poor turtle.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Oscar, Or we could cremate it.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator, And Maeby was having harder time finishing Warden Gentiles' screenplay than he did.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Maeby, You're a reader. How'd you like to read something fun that we could talk about on the way to the prison gala?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,George Michael," Oh, I'm actually going to sit that out. I'm just burnt out on prisons lately."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Maeby," Well, this might change your mind."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,George Michael, Is that a screenplay?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Maeby," Well, that's what you're going to tell me."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator, And Michael raced to warn his mother of the warden's intentions.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," Sorry, I forgot."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, Sorry.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lucille, Everything looks delicious.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Warden Gentiles," Oh, One Eye's a wonderful chef. I've had to go to his parole hearings twice, and lie through my teeth to keep him here."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," Hi, I just, uh... Wow. What are you guys doing?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, Thank you.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Warden Gentiles, (Mumbling.) I don't know why I always assume everyone's read my screenplay.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lucille, What is wrong with you? That man is being wonderful to us.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," And that doesn't concern you, Mother? For all you know, he could be trying to seduce you."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lucille," Oh, Michael, you're crazy."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, I certainly hope so.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lucille, I'm trying to seduce him.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," Who's the ""I"" in that sentence?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lucille, Me.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, You?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator, Her.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator, Michael had just discovered that his mother was interested in another man.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, Mom wants to sleep with the warden.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,G.O.B.," What? Oh, God!"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay, Great.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," Great? The man is old enough to be her contemporary, Lindsay. Plus, she's married okay? She can't be writhing around underneath..."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,G.O.B., What is wrong with you?! It's disgusting! God!
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, Take it easy.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,G.O.B.," No, it's just I've always had a thing about Mom and Dad being together."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, I know that.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,G.O.B.," I have a sense of propriety, my God."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," G.O.B., we've had this conversation."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,G.O.B., When?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, The last time you ended up seeing Mom and Dad go at it.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,G.O.B.," What? No, God, Michael... I did no such thing."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator, He did very much that thing when his parents got intimate in the conjugal trailer two years ago.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator," But, thankfully, he'd found a way to forget that."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,G.O.B., I've got a thing of pills in my pocket. I don't suppose I could convince you to grab me one?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator," Luckily, that worked, too."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,G.O.B., I can't even hear this.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay," You may not like it that Mom has needs, but it never bothered you when Dad was running around."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," Well, that was different."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay," Well, how about when she was sleeping with Uncle Oscar?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," The guy looks just like Dad. I don't know, he's family. It seemed very natural they'd be together."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,George Michael," Ooh, what-what... what is natural? Is there new legislation on this now?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator," George Michael was concerned about family love after reading Maeby's script, which he took as a subtle message to him from his cousin."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Boy Prisoner #2," Listen, new fish, that bunk was open because the last guy wouldn't do the things that you're going to do."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Boy Prisoner #1, We're going to do things?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Boy Prisoner #2," Anything can happen when two people share a cell, cuz."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,George Michael," Um, I'll.. I'll go with you to the prison."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," George Michael, what I want you to do is run upstairs and run a nice bath for Uncle Tobias, and I want you to help him get in the tub. Can you do that for me? Thanks."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Tobias, And don't make the water too hot- the scabs come right off.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," So come on, Lindsay, what are we going to do about mother?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay," Honestly, Michael, all this mother talk... you're starting to sound a lot like Buster."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator, And Michael realized there was somebody else in the family that would care about this.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, Buster's going to take this so hard. I cannot let my brother get hurt.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,G.O.B.," Oh it's on ""standby""! Got another one in you?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator," Buster, meanwhile, was enjoying ing with Oscar, but Oscar was longing for his sweet freedom."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Oscar," Say, you don't have any Sweet Freedom or Tropical Leaves, or any of the Hawaiian blends, do you?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Oscar, Someone's coming!
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Buster," Oh, get in the cage and hide behind the mirror, it'll look empty."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," Hey, Buster, listen. I got some bad news about Mom. She's planning on spending the night with another man."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Buster, G.O.B.?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, Not another brother.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Buster," Oh, then why do we care?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, What is wrong with everyone?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," Buster. You've got to talk to Mom about this. She can't possibly do it. If Dad finds out, he'll go berserk."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,"George, Sr.", Dad finds out about what?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," Well, I guess I've go choice now. Dad, I've got some bad news about Mom and Warden Gentiles... dating."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,"George, Sr."," Better sit down. (Breathing heavily) Okay, what's the news?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, They're dating.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,"George, Sr."," Oh, yeah, because she's my wife. Oh, yeah, damn it."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, Surprised you're not more upset about this.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,"George, Sr."," When you first told me. But you see, time passes. Besides, it's only dinner in the office. It's not Le Cirque."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, How'd you know it was in his office?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,"George, Sr.",00 in the afternoon?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael,00. You already know about this.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,"George, Sr.", Come on.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael," You're up to something, right? You both are. She's working the warden. You're making fake heads. You're planning an escape."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,"George, Sr."," How dare you. I ought to shave your head and make you sit under that camera all night, mister."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, Unbelievable. I was worried that this guy was gonna take advantage of Mom. You both were taking advantage of him. I don't know why I work so damn hard to keep this family together.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,"George, Sr."," Michael, can I talk to you for one sec?"
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Narrator," And that's George, Sr. got a call from Lucille."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,"George, Sr."," Howdy doody, that's it. Now you get back here so you can smuggle me out past the guards before Michael starts blabbing."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lucille," You know what? You can smuggle yourself out. You want to get away from me so bad, you're free. But I'm free, too, baby. I'm staying in the conjugal trailer with the warden tonight."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,"George, Sr.", Him?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, Hey. Why is there an ambulance out front?
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Tobias," Honey, the car is here."
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay, Hey. Do you need a ride? You'll have to lie down.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Michael, I'm not going. The whole thing is a scam. Mom was just using that warden to try to get Dad out. She's not trying to seduce him at all.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsay," Oh, no, she is. She's spending the night with him. She just called to ask me to bring her a tube of vag... is... table paste. Hi, George Michael."

3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,George Michael," Well, the new facility isn't so bad, huh? It's a lot like school, only it's air-conditioned. So I guess we can just, uh, just choose a cell to stay overnight in..."

3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Lindsey on Screen, No way. That horse hair is my ticket back into society. You'll cut it after those idiots at the gala accept me as one of their own.
3,Prison Break-In,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Prison_Break-In,Man #3 in Audience, We're giving money for this guy to keep his hair transplants?!

3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael, That was your idea?
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,George, I may have mentioned it.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," You told G.O.B. to do it, didn't you? Did you just want to get us at each other's throats again like you used to do with the Boyfights videos?"

3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Lucille, Don't look at me. I had nothing to do with them. Except for some of the Baby Buster shorts.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,George, Maybe I was trying to teach you something. Maybe I was trying to teach you how to compete. I didn't do it with Buster and look how he turned out.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Rolando, Is Buster.

3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Buster, They only wanted me because I had one hand. And I won't do it! That's not the way Mother is raising me.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," Like I won't compete with my older brother anymore, despite the way Father raised me. We'll show you."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Buster, Just like I showed Mr. al-Jibaaly Muhammed a-Abat. I stole the sign. Of course I left my hand there also.

3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," Hey, G.O.B., why didn't you tell me that Colombian thing was Dad's idea?"
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,G.O.B.," Well, Dad said not to, because you don't think I'm smart and that I should take credit for it."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," Well, it was just Dad trying to turn us against each other again. And of course, I think you're smart, okay? Hey, what's going on down there? What are you doing?"

And I'm trying to get her to renounce God and bleep me. And I just want to prove to her that I'm worth it."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," Well, as always, G.O.B., a mixed bag there, but the middle part sounded pretty admirable for a second, so here's what I want to do. I want to get you your own banana stand franchise, and you can have Steve work at it."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,G.O.B., You'd do that for me?
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," Yes. Yeah, you can design your own shack..."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,G.O.B., Choose my own location?
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," Whatever you want. You're gonna be 100% in charge, all right? But the most important thing is that we never let Dad turn us against each other again."

3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Narrator," G.O.B. had opened a new frozen banana stand, like, 20 feet from the old frozen banana stand."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael, What's going on? You just thought you'd put the stand right here?
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,G.O.B., Did the research. Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold here on this boardwalk than anywhere in The O.C.?
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael, Don't call it that.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,G.O.B.," Also, gonna need a check, 'cause I went out of pocket on the new sign. Oh, and I need some bananas and some chocolate from the other branch."

3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,G.O.B., You're just scared of a little competish.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," You know, you guys don't even have bananas, so I'm not too worried. In fact, you know what? Me and my son are gonna kick your little shack's ass."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,George Michael," Dad, it's okay. We can just work together with them."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Steve Holt," Dad, that makes sense. We don't really even know the recipe."

3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Buster," Oh, yeah, I'm trying it out. Guess who I ran into at the prosthetics shop while I was waiting for Mother?"
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,J. Walter Weatherman," Sorry, no refunds. And that's why you don't take your foot out of its wrapper."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Narrator, George Sr. had always used him to teach his children lasting lessons. They usually involved his prosthetic arm being ripped off.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,J. Walter Weatherman, And that's why you always leave a note.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,J. Walter Weatherman, You one of George Bluth's kids? Hey... I guess you'll be scaring children yourself now.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Buster," As a matter of fact, I won't. If anything, it strengthened my resolve to be more than just a one-armed man. Even if it means me never taking a job again."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael, Almost makes it worth it.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,George, he and Steve took in over $700.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael, They did?
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,George," Yeah. So, I guess the Bluth Company's got a new heir."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Narrator, And that's when Michael realized it was time to get serious.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael, George Michael? You know where the banana suit is?

3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,George Michael," That's not including the five minutes it takes to get out of this, right?"
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael, You're not getting out of it.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,G.O.B.," Attention, everyone! Why go to a banana stand when we can make your banana stand? I give you Barbara and Dee! Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,George Michael," Dad, are they strippers?"
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," If I know your uncle, they're at least strippers."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," Well, I guess we have to up the ante."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,George Michael," You know, Dad, then they're just going to up it, and it'll go back and forth all day."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," If that's what it takes, that's what we're going to do."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Narrator, And they did. But it was less entertaining than you might imagine- no matter what music was put under it.

3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," They're right, okay? This is insane. We're just ""Boyfighting"" again."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,G.O.B., And for what? A Hefty bag full of pesos.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael, You've been taking pesos?
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,G.O.B.," Well, dad said I should."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael, Dad's involved with this?
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,G.O.B.," Well, he chose the location. And the strippers. And the sign. Every part of it, really."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," Wait a minute, don't you see what's happening here? Dad's clearly going ahead with the Colombian deal and he's just laundering it through your banana shack. He pitted us against each other so I'd be too busy to notice."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," Well, you know what? I think it's time for us to teach dad a lesson."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,G.O.B., Get the person who terrorized us the most in our childhood?
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael, She's still healing.

3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Narrator, Michael and G.O.B. had decided to teach their father a lesson.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," So, we need the number of the one-armed man."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Buster, I'm not giving you that. You want to use his disability to scare someone. That's everything I'm against.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Buster," Read the button, Mister!"
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," (Slowly.) ""The only scary thing about a one-arm man trying to scare someone is the fact..."""

3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,G.O.B., (Screams.)
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Buster, Stop screaming. It's not scary!
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," I'm going to get the number myself, okay? Because we're not going to go through our lives being controlled by this guy."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael, What is more pathetic than grown men being scared of their father?
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Lucille, I'm thirsty.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Narrator," This continued for a while, and later Michael and G.O.B. went to put their plan in action."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," Well, I gave the Colombians back their money and I told them you had no right to make the deal. Have to warn you, though, they didn't sound too happy about it."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,George, What is that supposed to mean?
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,G.O.B., Kidnap... or... Michael said...
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,George," What, are you kidding? I have an ankle monitor. I can't even go into the hallway without the cops coming up."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael," Stop it. So, clearly you know what you're doing. There's an off chance they might just want to take you, leave the ankle. But... anyhow. (To G.O.B.) Stall him."
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Narrator, And Michael went to solicit help for the lesson.
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Michael, How would you and some of your friends like to help us teach Mr. Bluth a lesson? Maybe pose as Colombians?
3,Making a Stand,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Making_a_Stand,Eblin, But we are Guatemalan. Won't he know the difference?

3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael," What? Yeah... fine. Uh, yes, I don't care. What's up?"
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lindsay, I don't either.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Tobias, I don't know either.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator, It's this guy.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael, My son's just fine where he is. And he's got the SAT's coming up. You got to do well on those. You studying upstairs?
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael," Yeah, I'm just taking a three real quick, so I can get a cream soda."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lindsay," Oh, I'll get that for you."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael," No, I will get it. I have to get it myself. Just, relax... just check the stove."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Tobias," You know, Michael, if I may take off my acting pants for a moment and pull my analrapist stocking over my head, George Michael has been acting strange lately. I think he may have developed what we in the soft sciences refer to obsessive-compulsive disorder. Or the O.C. disorder."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Tobias, I think ultimately it's because he's afraid to express himself.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator," Actually, it was because he was afraid his Aunt Lindsay was going to burn the house down."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lindsay," (On phone.) Hi, how are you? (Pouring baking soda and cream together.) Cream soda."

3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lindsay, Great things.

3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lindsay, What kind of boarding school would lose track of its students?
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael, Openings is not a boarding school.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Tobias," I thought it was a boarding school, too."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," There goes that non-refundable tuition. You know, it is the one rule that they do have there."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lindsay," She should be punished for this. You know, Tobias, if I can become a more traditional mother, than maybe you could start being more of a..."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Tobias," Non-traditional mother. Yes, you're right. After all, I am her father."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael, Burners are still off and I re-washed all the clothes.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator," And that's when Michael decided that perhaps Maeby's tuition didn't have to go to waste after all. Meanwhile, Lucille went to work soliciting for the Bluth fund-raiser."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lucille," I mean, we have plenty of money, don't get me wrong. But we can't use our personal assets to defend the company."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator," Just then, G.O.B. arrived and decided to have a laugh."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,G.O.B.," Your drink, madam. (Chuckles.) Can I get you anything?"

3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,G.O.B., As you please.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator, But Lucille had never made eye contact with a waiter.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Waiter #7, Can you drop these off at two?
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,G.O.B., Why not. I'm just a waiter.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator, So he kept it up.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,G.O.B., We're all out of the halibut.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator, The joke was over... but the lunch rush was just beginning.

3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator, ...lunch was long overdue.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Buster, I don't suppose she left anything for me to eat?
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George," No, just the soup and a half sandwich and a whole sandwich for me."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," Hello. Hey, so what's going on with the fund-raiser?"
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George," Well, I don't think the Home Builders Organization is going to be supporting us."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," Yeah, the HBO's not going to want us. What do we do now?"
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George," Hey, we can have some celebrities in. You know, Oscar winners like Nicole Kidman..."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George, Nothing. But you're going to write a speech about me so they can see how wonderful I am.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael, I think we've got a better chance at Nicole Kidman.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," Actually, I may have an in with Andy Richter."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George," Do you think you can get him? I'm kidding. Of course, not him."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael, His brother does teach George Michael at Openings.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George, George Michael is going to that new age feel-goodery? I don't think that's a good idea. They're going to poison him against you. Remember what happened when we sent Lindsay to that kind of school? All of a sudden I was the bad guy to her.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Young Lindsay, And you don't respect Mom and you don't respect women.

3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," You know, George Michael's going to be just fine, okay? I just want him to know how to express himself."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Buster, It doesn't do anything.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator, He was actually having trouble expressing himself.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Donnie, Why don't you tell the group about yourself.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael, My name is George Michael Bluth. I'm a 16-year-old Caucasian male. My mom died. And I guess that's it.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Donnie," Hardly. See, if it were me, I would say I'm Donnie Richter. I have a brother named Andy. He's an attention hog. He can't seem to really attract a real audience, but I love the fat S.O.B. anyway."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael, I thought you looked like that guy Andy Richter. You guys are identical twins?
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Donnie, Here's what I want you to do. I want you to go home tonight and write something about how you really feel. Something critical. Bring it in tomorrow and read it for the group.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael, Will this go toward my grade?
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Donnie," (Chuckles.) We don't have grades here. A student either learns and gets an ""L,"" or they fluctuate in their learning."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael, What do we get for that?

3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Tobias," All right, I'll listen to this later. And don't tell me where you've been. It'll just make me worry more. But guess what? There's a new daddy in town."

3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Maeby," ""I know where you live. Ha-ha."" Casting directors hate this."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator, They really do.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Casting Director, The glitter queen struck again. Never hire Tobias Fünke.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator," And back at the country club, something unusual had happened."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,G.O.B.," Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale. Unless... did you expect me to follow you to your car?"

3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael, You know it might help if you expressed yourself.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator, It also gave him an opportunity to smell her neck.

3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lucille," No, it's not great."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," Well, am I the only one that thinks that this family is finally starting to become sympathetic and relatable? I mean, that's what people want to see."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael, Lindsay's taking care of the house.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lucille," Oh, I forgot about that. Tell the ""housewife"" she's not coming either."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Buster," If you don't want her, you don't want me either. She's taking care of me. She glued my thumb back on."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Buster," Sister's my new mother, Mother."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Buster," And is it just me, or is she looking hotter, too?"
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lucille," Well, why don't you marry her?"
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Buster, Maybe I will!
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael, We're veering away from relatability again.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator," Meanwhile, Maeby was getting tired of being with her father."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Tobias," Now what we do is we paint our lips Joan Crawford red, pop on a little blue eyeliner and then plant a lipstick kiss on every one of them."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Maeby, Why the blue eyeliner?
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Tobias," Well, she felt that her eyes were too close together."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Tobias," Hello? Uh, y... uh... (Whispers to Maeby.) It's a casting director. (Into phone.) Yes, he is available. Uh, let me put my, uh, our assistant on the phone with you. Thank you, yes. I better get changed."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Maeby," (Into phone.) Thanks, Deb. Yeah. So he's Tortured Victim #4, right? No, that's great. Yeah, he's really into discipline."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator," And George Michael was about to get some discipline, too."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael, You are no longer going to that school. I don't want to get into a big discussion about it. It's just not right for you.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael," Is this because I cheated off Maeby? Because I've never done that before, Dad, I swear. I just couldn't think of anything to write about you, so I asked her to write it about her dad."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael, You cheated?
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael," Yeah, it was stupid of me. Now Donnie's met you. I mean, he's never going to believe that you were ever up for a part in Wicked."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," Yeah, well, you know, you do what you have to do. You think I want to give that speech about Dad at the fundraiser? Sometimes you say you hate your dad to get a good grade or you like him to make some money. Sounds like you're doing a great job over there. We're keeping you in."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael," No, I wasn't..."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael, Said I don't want to have a whole discussion about it. Donnie... Oh.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," I guess I owe you an apology... It's Andy again, isn't it?"
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Rocky, Rocky. Andy's the pig.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael, Well you're not exactly...
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Rocky, I'm his stunt double You think I like this? I disgust myself.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael, Let go of my dad you're going to hurt him.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Rocky," Oh, no, I'm only making it look like that. He's totally in charge of the situation."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael, So what is the problem?
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Rocky, Somebody sent my brother Donnie a basket of poison muffins.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael, It could've been the Muffin Man. They never caught him.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael, How do you know about that?
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Andy Dick, And whatever happened to the Muffin Man? Remember him? I always pictured a giant six-foot muffin trying to eat me while I was eating him. It's kind of a fantasy I go to a lot now.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Rocky, And he says you threatened to poison him.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," I was upset. I'd just heard that my con thought I was a horrible father. But, no, I didn't poison him."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Rocky," Well, if I find out you did... Oh, Andy wants to know, at this dinner, you want him to sing or anything?"
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael, A song would be fantastic.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael," So, Dad, you saw that? I thought you didn't know what I said about you."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," Well, that wasn't exactly the truth. But don't worry, I know you don't have anything bad to say about me."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael," Well, no, you know what? I think Donnie was right. I just wasn't digging deep enough. I think I might've meant what I said. You never listen to me. You didn't ask me if I wanted to go to the school, you didn't ask me about what I said. You threatened my teacher. You don't respect me. How can I respect you, man?"
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator, It was a complex situation without an easy solution.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lucille, Hello? The caterers didn't show up. I used the club. They said we owe them too much money. I guess all those lunches... I've got 50 people coming in three hours and nothing to feed them. No one to serve it. We have to make a good impression or we're finished.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator, Now that's a clear cut situation with a promise of comedy. Tell your friends.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator, The Save Our Bluths Party was starting to heat up. But the same could not be said for Lindsay's chicken.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,G.O.B., What is going on? They're getting restless. I can't offer to bleep him in front of their husbands.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lucille, This is what you're making? Poached salmonella?
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lindsay, It'll be fine. I'll just put the sauce on them.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,G.O.B., What kind of sauce is that?
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lindsay," Wait, this is the water I thawed the chicken in."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Buster," Oh. Well, that should go with chicken."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lindsay, Yeah.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Buster, Fantastic.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator, And some powerful players showed up.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Larry," George, Bill Kinkaid from Phosco Industries."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator, Sort of.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Larry," Hope you don't mind, I sent one of those stupid surrogates."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George," You got busted, too."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Larry," No, I had a prior engagement. I'm at the Fire & Ice Ball."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,G.O.B., Coming through. Chicken in chicken sauce.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael, Thank you very much for showing up. Maybe you could just sing while they're bringing out the dinners.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Andy Richter," Uh, I'm not Andy. I'm Emmitt. Andy sent me over to let you know that he's not going to be able to make it tonight."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator," Michael was suspicious. I mean, think about it- We can't show Emmitt without blurring him."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Andy Richter," Yeah, he's... singing at the Fire & Ice Ball tonight."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George," Andy Richter is singing at the Fire & Ice Ball? I should send Andy a little basket of poison muffins, too."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," Muffins? Oh, my God, Dad. You're the Muffin Man? You poisoned 25 teachers during the '70s?"
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George, Just the first two. The others were copycats.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," You poisoned Donnie, didn't you?"
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George," We're losing them. Come on, come on."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George, Have your attention. My son would like to say just a couple of words about me.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator, And that's when Michael noticed his own son.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," You came, huh?"
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael," Yeah, well, it was wrong of me to say what I did about how I felt."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," No, you said what you felt. And maybe it's about time I did the same thing."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George, Why don't we just let him express himself.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," Well, um, I was going to say that you don't know who my father really is and that what has happened to us is a great injustice, that we were never really given a fair chance. But that's not the truth. We've been given plenty of chances. And maybe the Bluths just aren't worth saving, maybe we're not that likable, you know. We're very self-centered. And my father may be the worst of us. Me, too. You know, I seem to... I threaten people who I don't feel support me. He poisons them. Anyway, here's my advice to you. Go ahead and take yourself a goody bag and get out of here while you can."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator," The speech was disturbing, the food inedible and the gift bags... pretty frightening. And when G.O.B. realized he wouldn't get tipped..."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,G.O.B.," Wait, no, no! Where's everyone going?"
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator, ...the service got a little worse.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,G.O.B., No one's leaving until I get my money! I'll follow you to your cars!
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator," Oh, and then that old racist woman choked on Buster's thumb."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Buster, My thumb!
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator," All in all, it was one of the Bluth's better dinner parties."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," Hey, what'd you think of the speech?"
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael, You'd do great at Openings.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," You know, pal, you do not have to go there. I've just been very worried about your behavior. You know, you're always turning off burners and irons and it may be OCD."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael," OCD? No, I'm just cleaning up after Aunt Lindsay. She never turns things off."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," Well... Guess that explains why I saw the hedge trimmer zipping around the drive way. I did it again, didn't I? I'm so self-centered. From now on, I want you to just tell me what's on your mind, okay? And I promise I won't just hear what I want to hear."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,George Michael, I love my cousin.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," Love you, too, pal."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, the Bluth family gets some good news."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lucille, They're all sending in donations. And you know what the key was? Your speech. It didn't sound desperate.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," Well, I guess it really doesn't pay be desperate."
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Lucille, It sure doesn't.
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Director, And... cut!
3,S.O.B.s,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_S.O.B.s,Michael," Good job, man. Let's not celebrate yet. We still got the west coast feed, guys."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Narrator, Michael had received a witness list for his father's upcoming trial.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George, Who's on the list? Any blabbers?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," Well, they've got one guy who won't be talking. That is unless there's a hand inside of him."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Tobias," Oh, please, Michael. Even then, I wouldn't say anything."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," That's reassuring, but I was referring to G.O.B.'s puppet, Franklin."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B., Yes! I got him in the system.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, You did this on purpose.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B.," Oh, yeah. He is re-dyed, rested and ready to work. Thought it'd be a good way to get some press. Oh, I got to tell Franklin."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," I think he meant ""get Franklin."""
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Buster, Am I on the list?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, We all are.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B.," (Heard off screen.) Franklin, guess what?"
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Buster, But I don't know anything.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lucille, He certainly hasn't heard anything from me.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Buster, Mother doesn't know anything either.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lucille, I don't know anything.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," Well, you both certainly act innocent."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Narrator," Buster knew a great deal for Lucille, almost nightly, got drunk and told him."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lucille, Your father says he wants me to go all the way to Falluja. I thought he meant the sex act that's so popular with your generation.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Buster, (Snores softly.)
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lucille, I know you're awake. Faker!
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," More significantly, they've put an ""N. Bluth"" on the witness list."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B.," I hope that doesn't stand for what I think it stands for. Whoa, I did not say that."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," You did, G.O.B. Your mouth moved, your hand didn't."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B.," Oh. Well, I should work on that."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," Is the an ""N. Bluth"" in the family we don't know about? They say there's been money found in an account under that name."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George," Of course not. The prosecution is trying to test us, see if we're going to turn against each other. They make stuff up. She doesn't exist."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," Yet you refer to her as a ""she."""
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George," ""He,"" ""she""-what's the difference?"
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Tobias," Oh, hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Tobias, They're probably just taking a shot in the dark.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George," But the good news is that Jan Eagleman called, and she is willing to consider our case."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, Jan Eagleman?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George, She's from the Justice TV.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," Not another media whore? You know, frankly, I think I could put together a pretty good defense."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lindsay," Oh, no, he thinks he's a lawyer again."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Young Michael," / You're a crook, Captain Hook / / Judge, won't you throw the book at the pirate... /"
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lindsay," Michael, just because you played a role doesn't make it real."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lucille," Of course, Buster did grow up to be Captain Hook."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Buster," Not cool, Mom."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George," Oh, please, you'd be a lousy attorney. The first piece of evidence against us, you'd run for the hills."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George," No, Jan is interested. She carries a lot of weight, and she is not charging us anything."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Franklin, Like to see a whore that does that!
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B.," Not the carrying the weight part, but... on the other hand, if it's free."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George," She wants us to do a mock trial, sort of a dry run, just to get us ready."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," Well, I guess we could all use some experience in the courtroom. Fine, I'll go check her out, but I'll tell you all right now now one is going to lie on that stand."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George, And no one is going to betray the family.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Narrator, Buster was nervous.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Buster, (Nervous humming.)
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Narrator, That's what all the rocking and humming was about. And Michael met with Justice TV's Jan Eagleman who was currently doing a tech rehearsal.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Jan Eagleman, ...for my new show-Judge Reinhold. It's a reality courtroom show.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," You know there's an actor by that name, right?"
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Judge Reinhold, This is what they put me in. Why did I lose all the weight if they're going to put me in a pool cover?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, I'm sorry. Are you an actual judge?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Judge Reinhold," No, that's just a coincidence. I read somewhere Judge Judy made $25 million last year, and I'm, like, ""Hey, I never even heard of the guy."""
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," So you're doing this because your name is ""Judge""?"
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Jan Eagleman," Honestly, this is the first time I put those two things together."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Judge Reinhold," Maybe we should take ""Judge"" out of the title and go with my original title Mr. Reinhold's Courtroom. No, no, no. We're changing the name."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Jan Eagleman," Thanks, Michael. Got 250,000 talking magazine ads and he wan to change the name."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, I hear you want to do a mock trial.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Jan Eagleman, Mm.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, Yeah?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Jan Eagleman, And we can do it here on the set. 'Cause I'm looking for Judge Reinhold to have a little practice too.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, Uh-huh.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Jan Eagleman, I'll be acting as the prosecutor. That way I can see how your family holds up. Families that do well are the ones that stick together.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," Well, that-that's us. Um... we are going to need a defense attorney, right, for the mock trial and that's not going to be cheap."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Jan Eagleman, You know the case. Why not you?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Young Michael," / You're a crook, Captain Hook... /"
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," Yeah, give me a chance to show my dad what I can do. I'll-I'll show him. I'll make a fool out of him. While sticking together."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, One minute.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Narrator, And that's when Michael found out his brother Buster was in a coma.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, What happened? How is he?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lucille," Waiting for the doctor. I just pray it's one of those things where he's unconscious throughout the entire trial, and when it's over, he wakes up and gets a big toy."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," Wait a minute. Are you responsible for this, Mom? Did you put one of your sons into a coma so that he can't testify?"
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lucille," Michael, how dare you? Of course it crossed my mind. But this was all Buster. He got into your brother's pills."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B., He asked me for them. I didn't know. I thought he was dating again.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Brian," Hope you don't mind me saying, but these things can go on indefinitely. My mother's been in that bed for two years."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lucille," (Gasps.) Oh, how awful. We don't have a private room."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Brian, They won't let me take out her feeding tube. And I'm lucky. I have the resources to pay for these medical bills.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lindsay, You have resources?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Brian, What good is my money if I can't bring her back?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lindsay," But you can't, and money should be spent on dating. Is that what you were going to say?"
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, Let's go ahead and wait outside.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lindsay," So, you come here often? Cute button."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George Michael, How is he?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, We're still waiting to find out.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George," (Panting.) I got here as soon as I could. Oh, the red tape."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," Looks a little bit more like Red Prawn, Dad."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George," It's the Shrimpfest. Oh, the shrimp."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," You realize that Buster is probably in this state because of you and Mom. He's obviously afraid of what he knows and he's just trying to forget. Does he know who ""N. Bluth"" is?"
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George," Right now he doesn't know who ""B. Bluth"" is."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, I'm going to need some real answers out of you pretty soon because I've just discussed it with Jan. I am going to be pretending to be your attorney at the mock trial before Judge Reinhold.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George," You're the lawyer. Oh, that's the same representation Captain Hook had."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lucille," Oh, it's so good to laugh again."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B.," Oh, feels good."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George, It does.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lucille," Wait, not the Judge Reinhold show from all those magazine ads. They're all over the place. Look at this."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Judge Reinhold, (In magazine.) My name is Judge.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Dr. Farmer," Well, Buster's in what we call a light to no coma. In layman's term, it might be considered a very heavy nap."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, Could that mean that he's faking it?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Dr. Farmer," Oh, highly likely this is fake. Alough there doesn't seem to be very much brain activity."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lucille," Nope, that's him."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Dr. Farmer, I think it's very important that we remember he's fully insured. I say we see how this plays out.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George, Absolutely. And we're going to be here every day. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Dr. Farmer," Well, if this young man gets bored, we need a lot of volunteers here at the hospital. Turning over the bedridden, changing bedpans."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George Michael, I heard there's a mall across the street.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Dr. Farmer," Oh, you want excitement. Well, we have a group of young people who put on fake weddings for our Alzheimer's patients."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," Actually, it would probably look pretty good on some college application."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George Michael, Would I have to touch the old people?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Dr. Farmer, Only their hearts.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Dr. Farmer, You could be a groom. Bring a little girlfriend up there with you.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George Michael," Oh, I don't have a girlfriend."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Dr. Farmer," A sister than, or a cousin. Of course, you're going to have to kiss."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Narrator, Guess who liked that idea?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, He says he doesn't want to do it. I'm actually going to respect his choices...
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George Michael," Good. I... great. I was just... Well, don't answer for... I, um, yeah. 'Cause I know exactly the cousin, I mean, the.. the girl I would want to give and she'll want give too. We'll... and we'll do that together. For them, for the sake of... I ju... it's a great day. For being sad."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Narrator," And later, Michael was preparing for his case."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lindsay," So I've got a date with the guy with the brain-dead mom. I mean, it's just a...picket for them to pull the plug on our loved ones."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," Giving up hope on Buster pretty quickly there, Lindsay."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lindsay," Listen, I know Buster. I know what he wants."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Buster," Oh, I love soup. If the only thing I could do was lay in bed all day and eat soup, I'd be happy. I wouldn't even have to taste it. I could just take it through a tube. That would actually be better 'cause I wouldn't even burn my mouth. (Laughs softly.) Never let me die."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lindsay," Yeah, he wants out. Anyway, you and I both now he's probably just faking."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B., Busy?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, Actually...
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B.," Check is out. My lips don't move. They call me up to the stand, say something like, ""Who's this little friend?"" And he'll say..."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Judge Reinhold, (Voiced from Franklin.) My name is Judge.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B., (As himself.) Who's name is Judge?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Judge Reinhold, My name is...
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, Okay.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B., That's a silly name.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, That's enough.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Judge Reinhold, Judge. My name...
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B.," Yes, I am judging your name. It am silly."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Judge Reinhold, Is...
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, Please stop.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B.," Oh, now you're correcting my grammar?"
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," G.O.B., not going to put Franklin on the stand, and your lips are moving just little bit."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Judge Reinhold, Judge.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B.," He's right, his name is Judge now."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," You know, I think Dad might actually have a case here. I mean, I am concerned about this ""N. Bluth,"" but if it is indeed just a ploy on their part, then the only bombshell that they've got is the blueprint of an Iraqi model home, the same blueprint as ours, with no record that we actually got paid for it. Although this is strange. It looks like there's a secret room in this one off the hallway. I wonder if we've got that. I'm gonna check that out."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B.," Okay, and we're going to go back to the hospital."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," Yeah, good, check on Buster. We do need to stick together as a family on this."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,G.O.B.," Actually going to to swipe some more talking magazines, but I'll make sure to poke the head in."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Judge Reinhold, My...
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," ""Nichael Bluth""? Am I ""N. Bluth""? Is he trying to set me up? If I'm ""N. Bluth,"" I'm going to prison."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Narrator, Nichael was worried.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Narrator, Michael had just discovered a hidden room in the model home where all the family secrets were stored.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," My dad's trying to pin all of his crimes on ""N. Bluth,"" and I might be ""N. Bluth."""
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Tobias, Huh.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," At least that's what it says according to my birth certificate. All of our family records are up here. And, for some reason this stack of body building magazines."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Tobias," (Chuckles.) Well, I guess your, uh... your dad must have had these from way back when, huh?"
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Judge Reinhold, (In magazine.) My name is Ju...
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, That seems kind of current.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Tobias," Uh. Who am I trying to kid, Michael. I was trying to beef up to impress that wife of mine, but now she's after some rich guy who's trying to kill his mom, and..."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, I have to go talk to my dad. You coming out?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Tobias," No. No, I've got to fight for my wife. I'm going to keep my marriage alive."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Narrator," One room over, George Michael was also trying to convince someone to pursue a fake marriage."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Maeby, We'd have to kiss. Wouldn't that be kind of weird after what we've been through?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George Michael," Well, that was a long time ago."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Narrator, It had been two months since they'd kissed.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Maeby," Well, it does sound like a good twist on a wedding film."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George Michael, A film?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Maeby, Without the corny runaway bride bit in the middle.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George Michael," Oh, well, yeah."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Narrator," And, so, like many people who no longer felt anything for each other, they decided to get married."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," I'm ""N. Bluth,"" aren't I? Legally, that's my real name. You've been doing all the Iraq business under it thinking that it wouldn't be traceable. But it is, and I'm going down."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George," For God's sake, it's a typo, Michael. What kind of father do you think I am? They even got your birth date wrong."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, That is my birth date.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George, Close to Christmas. Was that hard?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George," It's a coincidence, Michael! You're not ""N. Bluth."" There is no ""N. Bluth."""
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," I called Jan Eagleman about this, and she says it sounds pretty bad."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George, You called her? She's with the prosecution.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, Just for the mock trial.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George," Yeah, but what if she wasn't, Mi... You know, I am glad we're having this mock trial, because it has shown me that you cannot be involved in the real defense."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," Oh, come on."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George, Why can't you be like Buster? He put himself in a coma to protect this family. Poor kid. I have to get down there now.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael," Shrimpfest is over, Pop."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,George, Really?
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Michael, Better go to Chili's.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Narrator, Back at the hospital...
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lindsay, Let my brother die!
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lindsay, All they're doing in there is trying to keep people alive. It's a life mill!
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Tobias," Oh, hello, Lindsay. I'd like to introduce you to friend of mine that I met at the gym."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Father Ben, Hi. I'm Father Ben.
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Tobias," Ben is a Franciscan who can bench press over 200 pounds, and he talked me into protesting, too. Show them your sign. No, the other side."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Lindsay," Tobias, Brian and I beleive in the dignity of every human being. Now why don't we leave the fruits with the vegetables and go get a coffee."
3,Fakin' It,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Fakin%27_It,Tobias, Do some push-ups. Lindsay! Do some push-ups.

3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay," Well, you know, maybe I would be more attracted to you if you were in better shape. You know, if were just more muscular and masculine. Does that make me shallow?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias, No. I was going to say the same thing to you.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," Maybe we should take a little time to work on ourselves, and then we'll plan a special night in seven or eight days."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay, Or a couple of weeks.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias, Let's say three weeks.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay, We're going to go for it in a month.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias, Starting at the start of next month.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay, And we're going to call it a 31-day month.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias, Even though is particular month has 30 days.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay," Oh, you know what? I've already prepared a list of ""won'ts."""
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," Oh, you're lot going to believe this. My list of ""can'ts."""
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Marital love can be so romantic.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George Michael, What's that supposed to mean?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, What?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George Michael," Marital love. You were looking right at me, and you said marital love."" I don't... Why would I...?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George Michael, We're married?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," ...was, in fact, as real and binding as the rice pudding the disoriented patients had thrown at them."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, I was talking to your aunt and uncle.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George Michael," Oh. Oh, of course. They're married, too. Each other."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B.," Oh, please. Pity the fool who gives me a bunch of jibber-jabber about romance. My religious girlfriend just dumped me, and for a simple little misunderstanding. I mean, if someone was always asking you to embrace the Holy Trinity, what would you think they meant?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, G.O.B. thought it meant a three-way.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B., What? I thought that's what all you guys lived for. What about you? You game?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Well, maybe she just wasn't for you."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B., Which one?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, I don't know. I really wasn't paying attention.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B.," The real problem is, she keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The... something of my ways. Wisdom?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, It's probably wisdom.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," G.O.B., listen. Can I ask you a question? Do you remember growing up with a sister?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B.," Sister? Uh... No, I don't. Not really... ringing any bells."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Other than Lindsay, of course."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B., Oh! Lindsay!
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Well, you might not be the most reputable source on this."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," Upstairs, George Michael was sharing his news with his cousin."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Maeby, You mean we're married?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George Michael, No. It's just a piece of paper. It doesn't mean anything. I mean...
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Maeby, We should shred it. It's creeping me out.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George Michael," Yeah. Me... But, if we just put it over the dresser, like we think it's a joke, and we would always know..."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Maeby, It is a joke.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George Michael, I know. Unless we get it framed.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, And Michael went to investigate his mystery sister.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lucille, Michael! What a surprise.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Really? Were you expecting somebody else? Maybe, uh... one of your two daughters?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lucille," Oh, Lindsay and Tobias never visit. (Laughs.) Oh, we're so bad!"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, I... I actually meant Lindsay and Nellie.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lucille," You call him that, too? It's so nice to be able to talk like this."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Where's Dad? What's all this?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George, Computer stuff from the office.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," No, no. No, no, Pop. You're not doing another one of those Black Fridays, are you? Your mass firings?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," Before firing his employees, however, George Sr. had been sure to clear the office of its valuables."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Employee #1," So, when do we get to see our new, fancy office?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George," Soon as you get your new, fancy job. You're all fired."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," The employees never saw it coming, even though their first task was often to unload computers from a rental truck."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George," No, it's not a Black Friday, although I did enjoy those. No, the prosecution is going to want to have access to the hard drive, so I just want to make sure everything is nice and clean for them."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, What the hell is that thing?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George, An electromagnet. Think of it as a giant delete key.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Well, I hate to spoil your fun, Dad, but I got backups on all of that stuff, and this is illegal."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George," Oh, well, excuse me, Judge Reinhold, but I am trying to protect my family."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lucille," That's not a real gold necklace, is it?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George," Well, it wasn't really your 50th birthday."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," You know, Dad, you can't have this stuff in here, all right? And we don't need more trouble. It's bad enough you got Buster faking a coma just so he doesn't have to testify."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lucille, I've been trying to get him out of that coma. It's costing us a fortune. He's sleeping us dry.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lucille," Okay, faker, I'm cutting the cord. I'll see you at the snack machine."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," If he knows that you don't want him in the coma, then why is he still in it?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lucille, For some reason he won't tell me.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, He had fallen for his day nurse.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Adelaide, You're so dear.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, She found his complete lack of personality and movement enchanting.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Adelaide," I wish you would say something. Of course, if you did, everything would be ruined 'cause you wouldn't be as pure."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Speaking of living a lie, I don't suppose either one of you have remembered who this N. Bluth is, huh? Not a Nick or a Nellie?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George, Just the one who married Lindsay.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lucille," (Laughing.) Oh, it isn't fun to talk like this?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, So Michael returned to the office where the atmosphere was paranoid.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Ted, Is it Black Friday?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, No one's getting fired. No one's getting fired
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Dave," But we haven't been paid, and they took our computers."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," I know how this looks bad, but it's just my father trying to erase all the hard drives to avoid conviction. The company is fine. This is fun, though, isn't it? They brought out all the old machines I mean, they've seen better days, but I'm sure they're all functional, right? Like Tom here."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tom, I'm 30.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, You're kidding!
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, But Michael found the equipment frustrating as well.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," ""G.O.B.'s Program""? Idiot."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, And then he noticed something else.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," ""Nellie."""
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," Michael, got to talk... Oh, wow. K-Y Pro, huh? Hey, don't get any moisture on these bab..."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Hey. Tobias... buddy, I needed that information. This is that sister I been looking for."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," Well, just hit, uh, print screen. I'm sure whatever's on there will come up."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Oh, look at that. Kind of remember these being faster, you know?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," Yeah, well, we were probably all so jacked up on amyl and disco music, we didn't notice. But you know what? I'm glad about this printer lag, because I was hoping to have a jaw session with you."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Well, why don't we just say-as long as that means a talk."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias, I find myself attracted to someone who is not my wife.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, What's her name?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias, Michael. Can you believe it?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, You're married to my sister.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias, Don't you think I know that?!
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, I-I'm not interested in you that way.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias, What way?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Pick one.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," No. No, did you think you were the Michael I was talking about?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Wh-Wha...?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," (Laughing.) No, no... Interesting that your mind went there, though. Okay, uh, no. Uh, I'm afraid the Michael I'm talking about is all lady."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, I see.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias, She's the trainer at my gym.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, The trainer you started with today?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias, Indeed. Can you believe she's a body builder?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Hm. Indeed.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias, What am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," You're nervous about becoming intimate with Lindsay again. You probably should not rush into things, you know? Don't call this girl Michael. Stay away from the gym. Just leave it alone."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," Wise words, Boy Michael. I'll tell you, if I wasn't so dripping and disgustingly sweaty right now I'd hop over this desk and give you such a hug."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Mm.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," Hey, coulda, shoulda, woulda."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Hey, hey. No, no. Ooh, look, number's up. Well, it would've been a seven."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," Later that night, Lucille visited Buster in the hospital."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lucille, What the hell is this?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Van Heusen," My name is Representative John van Heusen, and I am here to protect the dignity of this boy's life."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lucille, Dignity? Easy for you to say-I'm the one who has to loofah his stump
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Van Heusen," I believe death is wrong in all of its forms. Except lethal injection, but that's just as a deterrent against more death. (Chuckles.) And this young man is enjoying life! Hey! Hey! Huh? Hey, look us, huh? We're having a blast here. (Laughing.)"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lucille, How the hell'd you even find out about Sleeping Beauty here?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Van Heusen, It was an anonymous tip from someone who cares about Buster's life.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lucille, It's not ringing any bells.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," In fact, it was Buster himself."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Van Heusen," Well, no one's killing Baby Buster on my watch. That is unless, of course, it's as a penalty in a three-strike scenario."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lucille, No one's called him Baby Buster since high school.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," Michael, meanwhile, had called one number after another until he found Frank, a colleague of the woman he knew as Nellie."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B.," (As Frank.) Yeah, well, she's working a software convention at some hotel. I could set up a meeting at the bar, man."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Appreciate it.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, And so Michael arrived at the bar hoping to spot someone who could be his sister.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," She grew into the nose. That Nellie? Hey, hi. Michael. Frank sent me. I think I might be interested in your services."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie, You won't be sorry.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Yeah? I was hoping that maybe we could just talk a little bit first, huh?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie," Yeah, most people want to."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," And they did talk, and Michael felt a connection like he'd never felt with anyone in his family."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," I had a locker on the first floor, freshman year, right next to the caf, with all the junior lockers so it was clearly a mistake, but I didn't say anything. Right?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie," Ooh, you're bad."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," I had that same locker all throughout the sophomore year. Junior year, they had me up on the third floor with all the frosh."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie, That is wild.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Had the same combo all throughout, because they..."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," Hey, let's see what some of the other folks are up to."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, Nothing there.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, Or there.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Music," / Oh, my. / Oh, my. /"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," Oh, my. Let's get back to Michael."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Okay, because it was Joe Namath's number, Babe Ruth's number, then my birthday."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie, That is a great story.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, It wasn't a great story. Nellie was just a great listener. Most prostitutes are.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Nellie, the hell with formalities. I think you and I should do business together."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie," Me, too."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, Michael had just hired a woman he secretly believed to be his sister.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, How did you get into this line of work?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," But of course, he'd also yet to figure out she was a prostitute."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie," Well, I was buried in loan debt from business school, so I started whoring myself out."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, Not that there weren't clues.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie, What do you say we go up to my room and seal the deal?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," You're staying here, huh?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," I was actually hoping to get into your business tomorrow and it would give you a chance to meet everybody in the office, you know, because you're going to be working for the whole staff. You'll be filling like three openings."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie, Oh. I heard there were a couple of girls like me consulting over at Enron.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," And so, the next day, Michael introduced his new consultant to his staff, who weren't that pleased to meet her."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Ted, You hired someone else? We haven't even been paid yet.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," That's exactly why I hired her, to help out with the finances. She's absolutely amazing at that stuff, right? You do do finances and stuff, right?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie, I do all sorts of scenes.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," There you go. Okay, guys, don't be afraid to put her in any position that you want, okay?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Dave, you give her access to everything, okay? I want you guys to think of her as Nellie Bluth, all right? In fact, we should probably get an I.D. with that printed on it, okay?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, But she did have a list of won'ts.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie," We're gonna have some ground rules first, okay? No bleep bleep bleep or bleep. And no bleep unless you're wearing a bleep or you bleep bleep. If this winds up on the Web, I will bleep you in the bleep."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Ted, Our computers don't even work on the Internet.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie, Who's first?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," Back at the model home, George Michael was still trying to make his accidental marriage work."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George Michael," Hey, I thought tonight we could pop in [bleep] in the old DVD player and sit and watch it maybe just the two of us, husband and wife? I'm just kidding. The State of California isn't, but... You know, that's what makes it funny."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Maeby, I'm worried you're taking this too seriously.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George Michael, Just the opposite.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Maeby, What the hell was that?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George Michael, I bought you a wedding ring... tone. Opposite of serious.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," And Michael was getting an update on how his newest employee, Nellie, was working out."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," (Into phone.) Really? And all the guys like her, huh? That is, that is, that is great. Uh, you mean ""away,"" though, right? Because otherwise it sounds a little different, but, uh, that's, uh, that's outstanding. You forgot to say ""away"" again. But listen, let me call you back in a bit, okay? Bye. (To Lindsay.) Nellie has blown them all away."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay," Yeah, well, I think it's crazy. You've given her access to everything- the banking and for what? I mean, you're basing this whole thing on the fact that she shares a name with someone you played with as a baby."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Lindsay, I can tell that it's real. It's like that feeling that you read about twins having."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay, We're twins. You didn't give me access to the banking.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," No, you'd just, you'd go out and you'd just whore it up, Lindsay, you know? Now she's different. She's a little bit more like me. It's like we finish each other's..."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay, Sandwiches?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Sentences. Why would I say...?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay, Sandwiches?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, That time I was going to say sandwiches.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay, So I guess you haven't told Nellie what you're thinking.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," No, I have not I've been waiting for the right time. I want to make sure that she trusts me, you know. Especially since Dad is probably setting her up. But I might want to hurry with that whole operation because she's charging us a fortune, and of course, she's got this old boss that's claiming he wants a percentage."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B.," (On phone, unbeknownst to Michael.) Yo, man, you owe me money. I ain't no dummy. It better be soon or you're going to feel my hand up your bleep."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, So Nellie wants to meet me tonight for drinks. Maybe I'll tell her then.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay," That's funny. I'm going out tonight for drinks, too, with an exciting new man."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Really trying to make that marriage work, aren't you?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay," Well, excuse me, Judge Reinhold, but I'm feeling a little pressure here. I mean, if you had to have sex with Tobias in four months, you'd be shopping for a way out, too."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, I stand corrected. And disgusted.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, And Michael arrive for his meeting with Nellie.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Bartender, Are you Michael?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Yes.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Bartender, There's a Nellie at the end of thear who wants to see you.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Great. Thank you. Oh, it's Tobias."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," Michael, look, this has got to stop. I mean, flattered? Yes. Intested? Not tonight."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, I-I think I see what's happening. You're meeting girl Michael at the bar?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," It was her idea. She wanted to get a drink. I know it's crazy. I mean, I'm married. And the carbs!"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, That's why sometimes life is about making difficult...
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias, Sandwiches. I know.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, You read my mind.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," Oh, God, here she is."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Next to that guy?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias, What guy?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, That guy.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," No, that's her."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Him?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," That's a girl. I think the name ""Michael"" is making you look for a man."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, I think I'm looking at a man.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias, Michael.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Yes?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Girl Michael, Yes?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," No, I meant Girl Michael."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, I'm gonna leave you two alone.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Girl Michael," So nice to meet you, Girl Michael."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Hello? Yes? Hi, Nellie. I was thinking that we could meet down here, um... Actually, I think I'm going to come up."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie, I really need to see you.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Yeah, I really wanted to see you, too. There's something we need to talk about."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie, I've always been mildly attracted to you.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, What?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie, Let's face it. There's no denying that there's a heat between us.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, I'd like to deny that.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie," I know you feel it, too. This burning desire."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, I-I-I don't feel anything. I-I-I feel a burning mutual respect.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie, I've got an outfit that's going to turn that respect into something fun.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Respect is fun.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Nellie, you know, you're going to want the respect when you hear what I... Where is the light?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B.," (In a deep voice, unknown to Michael.) Don't touch that light."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, What?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B., This is what happens when you steal from Frank's stable without paying. You want to be her pimp? You got to settle up.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Pimp? You mean that she's...?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B., A lady of the evening. Working girl. She turns illusions for money...
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, And that's when Michael recognized the voice.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B., ...tricks.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Wait a minute.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B., Don't you do it! Ain't nobody going to see what Frank look like!
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Franklin is Frank?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Music, / Mr. F. /
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, Michael had just discovered that his brother was the pimp for the woman he thought was his sister.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, What the hell is going on? Nellie is not a prostitute.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B.," Of course she is. Oh, but I can see where the misunderstanding is. You didn't now. Maybe we can give him a family discount."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Family discount is right, G.O.B.. This is the sister that I've been talking about."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B., Maybe I should have been getting a family rate. Oh my God.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, How do you know her?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B., Met up with her after a show.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, And you did things with her?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, He didn't.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B., I did.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," Well, if you consider crying like a girl doing something."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B.," I just want my brother to respect me, you know? I mean I don't even have a job."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie," Look, I could use a man's voice on the phone. And I like your little puppet show."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B.," (As Franklin.) I ain't so little when I take my pants off, lady. (As himself.) I mean, obviously I'd take some of the cry out of that."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B.," But I am not a pimp, Michael. She needed protection. So I make some threats, wear this hat, and I collect my ten percent."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Yeah, that's a pimp."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, And our sister is a prostitute.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie, I'm your sister?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," I think so. I found you in my dad's computer, and I thought that maybe he was embezzling money and taking advantage of you. That's why I hired you to do your work at the office."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie," Oh, my God."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, What kind of work did you do? No wonder they were so happy.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie," I'm, I'm so embarrassed."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Nellie, hang on a second. You know, G.O.B., this might be that sign from God that you should change your ways."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B.," No, I think that's going to be something big."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," Downstairs, meanwhile, Lindsay arrived at the bar for her date."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay," Michael. Oh, my God, my husband!"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," Oh, my God, my wife! Are you two here for each other?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay, Is that what you're doing?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias, How dare you?!
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay, How dare you?!
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias, And with another woman!
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay, And with another man!
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Girl Michael," Wait, wait. You didn't plan this together? I just assumed you wanted a Holy Trinity."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Lindsay, Absolutely not! We're a happily married couple.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Tobias," Yes, who happen to be very much in love with each other."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Girl Michael," Well, you're still going to have to pay Frank."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Music, /Come on!/
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, And Michael confronted his father.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, I know who N. Bluth is. It is Nellie. And I found her.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George," That's your sissy cousin Larry. Even then we knew. That's why we called him ""Nellie."" Do you not know that expression, Michael? I thought we were on the same page here."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," That's a nice try, Pop, but in your old computer, I found a Nellie. You're trying to tell me that is not my sister?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George, Yes. It's perfectly innocent. She's my prostitute. I'm a red-blooded man. I have certain needs that your mom can't satisfy.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, But sex wasn't one of them.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George," (Sobbing.) I just want my brother to envy my money, but he's got that hair Why can't I have hair and money and him nothing?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, She's not my sister. I let her into the company.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George," You didn't give her access to the cash, did you?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, She said she liked me.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George," She's a prostitute! That's her job! Oh, no, the N. Bluth account."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, What? The N. Bluth account? That is your account?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George, Maybe. But it's only embezzlement if you spend it outside the company. It's gone. It's empty. She got to it.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Well, there goes the company."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George," Okay, now, hold on now. Let's not panic because I-I know someone who can find her. His name is Frank."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, That's G.O.B.'s puppet.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George, I'm going to prison. You haven't heard from Oscar lately have you?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, No.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,George, Okay.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Hey, Ted."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Ted, Yeah?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, What's going on?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Ted, Nellie got all of us our checks and these great new computers and have you been...?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Excuse me. Nellie, you did this?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie," I took it out of the N. Bluth account. And if you spend it within the company, it gives the prosecutors nothing. Also, it was the only way to get myself the ten grand that you owed me."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Ten grand? What did you do with these guys, exactly?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie, They mostly just cried. You've got a real morale problem here.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, You cried?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Listen, I thought that you were going to..."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie, Steal it?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Yes!
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie," But I might be your sister, remember?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Well, the fact that you didn't steal it might actually be proof that you're not."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael," Even if we're not related, I think I would like for you to work here. You're very, very good at it. What you do for a job is not really a great way to make a living, you know?"
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Nellie, I make 300 grand a year.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Michael, Marry me. It's weird on so many levels.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, G.O.B. has a religious conversion..."
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B., I've seen a sign. And I want to make this work. A committed relationship that actually means something.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,G.O.B., How about you? You want to do just the two of us?
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator, ... and Buster's fake coma is put to its greatest test.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Van Heusen, (Crawls into bed with Buster.) Don't you die on me.
3,Family Ties,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Family_Ties,Narrator," Oh, my."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, Michael was preparing his sister for her upcoming deposition in the case against their father.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," If they say ""Did you know of any financial improprieties,"" you'll...?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Lindsay, Unbutton my shirt a bit and give him this look.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, Not really sure what you're going for there.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Lindsay," Yeah, I'm sorry, I drank a lot last night."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Yeah, why were you drinking?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Tobias," If I look like a man who made love to his wife last night, it's because I almost did."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Lindsay, That's why.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, But Tobias had a low tolerance for alcohol.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Tobias, (Slurring.) You look very hans...
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, And so you just finished off the bottle?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Lindsay," Well, I had to. It's vodka. It goes bad once it's opened."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, I think that's another one of Mom's little fibs.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," You know, like ""I'll sacrifice anything for my children."""
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Lindsay, Speaking of Mom... she really doesn't want me to do this deposition.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Well, you have to, Lindsay. Sorry, you've been subpoenaed."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Tobias, I'm afraid I might not be able to be deposed either. I got a call out of the blue for a chance to play a very important part in The Prosecution.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, The prosecution called you?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Tobias," I assume it's a CBS procedural. Although they didn't send sides, so I thought I'd trot out a Vagina Monologue, or something else I know. And they did ask for old photos a documents so I went and got these out of the secret room."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, The prosecution is not a TV show. It's clearly somebody in the D.A.'s office trying to get you to flip. These guys will bend the law to enforce the law.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Tobias, Tell me that's not a CBS franchise.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," I'm serious, Tobias. Why else would they want all these documents?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Tobias," For set dressing, silly. Those Hollywood shows are so incredibly detailed."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Well, you're going to call them and tell them you're not interested. We all have to be careful, okay? The prosecution is going to be coming after all of us."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael, Including me?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, Hmm? No. You don't have any secrets.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael," Oh. (Chuckling nervously.) Yeah, , I... Um, hey, speaking of that, uh... it's actually her birthday soon, so I thought we could all do something for her."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, Whose birthday?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael," Maeby's. I was changing the subject. We- no, yeah, we weren't talking about Maeby. But she's been feeling kind of left out of the family lately so I thought maybe we could throw her a surprise party, you know."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator," Actually, he'd already told her about it."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Maeby," Well, I just poured Mom into bed. Would it kill her to let some vodka go bad?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael," Oh, no, vodka doesn't..."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Maeby," You know, it's my birthday in a week and I bet you they don't even know. They forget every year. I should just move out."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael, But they're planning a surprise party for you. They wouldn't forget your 16th birthday.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Lindsay," Oh, my gosh. Our little girl's turning 14."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael," 16, actually."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Tobias," Well, I am off to buy the perfect present. Maybe she'd like a suit like this."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, That is her suit.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Tobias, They probably don't make it in a woman's though.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, They only make it in a woman's.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Tobias," Well, I'm off, my love."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael," You see, sometimes shame can be fun."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, Shame?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael," Secrets. You said ""shame."" He said ""shame."""
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., How does he know about her?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, Hmm?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., Didn't he say that G.O.B. should be ashamed of himself?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," No, but give it a little while, somebody will."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, What's all that for?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., It's for my out-of town act.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Out of town? G.O.B., the prosecution is watching every move we make."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B.," Michael, I'm just going to Iraq."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," No, you're not."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B.," Yes, I am."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," No, you're not. Dad is up on treason charges for building homes in Iraq."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., It's a USO tour.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, You're not going.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B.," Yes, I am, and I'm doing my whole Christian magic act that my religion girlfriend helped me work out. I dress up like Jesus, walk on water, which you've seen. And I do the wine into water..."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," It's ""water into wine."""
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., Then I emptied out all your wine bottles and filled them with fake stuff for nothing.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Tobias," Great, how am I supposed to have sex with my husband now?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," G.O.B., we've got the depositions, okay? You're not going to Iraq."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., You're just jealous that I am the son that the father has asked to do his work in the Holy Land.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, So Dad is behind this.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., And won't bump me up to business class.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator," Later that day, Tobias met with the prosecutor, Wayne Jarvis."

3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Tobias, I was just looking for some feedback.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Wayne Jarvis, It was a little contrived.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Wayne Jarvis," Now, we think we can offer you a good deal if you provide evidence that puts George Bluth behind bars."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Tobias," Well, I'll tell you what else is contrived, the odds that I would turn on my family for somebody who is not only trying to hurt them, but who wouldn't know good acting if it marched through the door and gave them headshots and decorative soaps."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator," And as Tobias waited for the elevator, he noticed an interesting flier, promising e perfect gift for the daughter who didn't feel a part of the family."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Wayne Jarvis, He took the bait.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Cho, He's a classic scrapbooker.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Wayne Jarvis, Right down to the woman's suit.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, And Michael went to confront his father about G.O.B.'s trip to Iraq.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, Everyone knows that you built homes for Saddam Hussein. Please tell me what's going on.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,"George, Sr."," For the millionth time, I was a patsy. I've got to find a loophole to get out of this, but Buster took coma, and your mother took rehab."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, You're going to rehab again?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Lucille, I'm bringing Lindsay. I'm worried about her.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Lindsay, Did you get the corkscrew?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," So there's going to be wine at the rehab, huh?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Lindsay," Well, wine only turns into alcohol if you let it sit."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, How do you come up with these?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," So I guess I'll just meet with the prosecutor, ask for a postponement, but that means I'm going to have to go on the record about why you two aren't there. And if you make a liar out of me, we're in big trouble."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,"George, Sr.", This constant bickering is going to put me in a coma!
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Nice try, Dad."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, But Buster was finding his fake coma hard to sustain.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Adelaide, It takes a lot of courage to endure what they put you through. Especially since your mother saw that website.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, Buster was not only providing medical students a live body to learn on...
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Resident," That's okay. Try again... No, that's a tendon. He'd be screaming right now."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster, (Low moaning.)
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, ...he'd also served as a human canvas for both aspiring beauticians...

3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Dentist," Oops, you've got your forearm right on his windpipe there, Dogbone."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, It really was amazing for their self-esteem.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Student, I did it.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, Even Buster was moved. But he endured it all for Adelaide.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Adelaide," I love you, Buster. Oh, what would give to hear you say you love me, too. Even if it meant you'd been faking this whole time. Speak to me. Say anything, my love."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster, Anything?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Adelaide, (Gasps.) Faker!
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster," No, I wasn't faking my love for you. I just don't want to testify at my dad's trial."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Adelaide," Well, you're a coward!"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster, No!

3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, She was wrong on that one. It was love that made Gary take that step.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Adelaide," Oh, whoever said vegetables were good for your heart."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster," No, no, no. No, please. (Whimpers.) (Cries out.)"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator," Of course, he hadn't used his legs in three weeks. And Michael met with Wayne Jarvis."

3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Wayne Jarvis," Michael, your mother and your sister are not in a rehab center."

3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Wayne Jarvis, Cool your Japanese jets.

3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Wayne Jarvis, And imagine the impact if that had come on right when we turned on the TV.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, Michael had been called to sign his brother out of the hospital.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Buster, you can stop pretending to be in a coma. We heard your request on the way over."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster," I'm not faking it, Michael. I really am this expressionless. My love thinks I'm a coward just because I was using precious hospital resources to avoid my legal obligation."

3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, I'm not ready to call it that.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, And they arrived at the prison the Americans were training Iraqis to run.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,US Soldier, What did you forget? Walk them through the...? The what?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Iraqi Soldier, The metal detector.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,US Soldier, That's okay. Try again.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B.," My God, you came!"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Okay, okay."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B.," Oh, I missed you, Michael!"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, All right.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., Or should I say robot.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," What, 'cause'm not crying?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B.," Maybe you don't have enough RAM to understand this, Michael, but there's such a thing as brotherly love."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., What's he doing here? I thought he was in a coma.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster, I was trying to prove to this nurse that I'm brave. I need to get a picture of you with the insurgent. I can send it on my phone.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, Why were you arrested by the Americans?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., I was just doing a little off-mission street magic. Trying to make a few dinars.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., And that is why Jesus was often referred to as the King of Kings. Queens. The King of Queens.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B.," And now I would like to behold one of the late great Jesus' biggest illusions, The Burning Bush."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Crowd," (Chanting.) Burn Bush, burn Bush, burn Bush, burn Bush..."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, But soon the becurity forces arrived to suppress what now appeared to be an anti-American demonstration.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Crowd," Burn Bush, burn Bush..."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,American MP," That's okay, use your foot. The thigh bruises. What doesn't? Try again."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, So you weren't doing anything for Dad?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B.," Well, Dad... I mean, he had said if I happened to be in the neighborhood of Sadr City or Momoon, would I mind torching a couple model homes. But you know, Dad's just trying to keep information out of the hands of the Iraqis."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, I have a feeling he was trying to keep information out of the hands of the federal marshals.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., I'm going to go collect my things and say my good-byes. You guys check me out of here.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," G.O.B., you're an enemy combatant. It's not going to be that easy. I mean, I'll talk to them, but you might want to prepare for a long stay."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B.," Oh, shoot, I forgot to say good-bye to Yousef."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, That was a lot easier than I expected. Almost too easy.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B.," Hey, why aren't we going to the airport?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Well, I want to go check out this house Dad asked you to burn down. See what he's hiding. (To cab driver.) I think that's it, sir."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster, (Makes Arabic-like sounds.)
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Buster, this guy speaks English."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster," Oh, no. I swallowed a moth."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Richard Shaw," I'm sorry it took so long, but the Cheney Expressway was backed up all the way to Halliburton Road."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Let's see what all the mystery is about, huh?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, And that's when Michael found someone the U.S. government had been able to depose.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Saddam, Hello.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster, Take my picture! Take my picture!
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, Michael was in Iraq when he came across a familiar face.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Easy on that for a second. Are you, uh...?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Saddam, I am Saddam Hussein. Look-alike. Who are you?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," I'm Michael Bluth. These are my brothers, Buster and G.O.B. Bluth."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Saddam #2, Bluth? Is he here to fix the air-conditioning?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, Are you both Saddam Hussein look-alikes?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Saddam #4, Hardly. Invite them in.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Saddam, I am behaving like an Uday look-alike.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Saddam #2," Come on in. Come on in, guys."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, I'd always heard that there were Saddam Hussein look-alikes. I guess I'm just a little surprised to see you all living here in one house that looks so similar to ours.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B.,Scar on that one dude's forehead's got to be a problem.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Saddam, That's Achmed. Never stops watching the trial. We are all following it pretty closely.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," I understand. They put this guy away you guys are out of a job, huh?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Saddam #4," Yes, and we wanted to keep the house for just one more season."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Saddam #2, I have a baby on the way.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Saddam #3, I do a better Saddam than this guy. My Saddam would show his teeth.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Saddam #4," Yes, to chew the scenery."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator," And so Michael decided the least he could do was take a look at the air-conditioning. But before he did, he decided to see if there was a secret room in this model home as well. And that's when Michael discovered the bombshell."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, Buster!
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator," And back at the American model home, none of the invitees had showup for Maeby's party."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael, Surprise.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Maeby," Yeah, that's what I figured. So, did you send one of these to everyone in my address book?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael, Yeah. I'm really sorry they didn't come. I don't know what happened.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Maeby, I do. They found out I was 16.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, And a lot of us just didn't want to drive down to Orange County.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael, What are you talking about?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Maeby," This cost me my job, George Michael. I was a studio executive. I made movies."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael," Well, is that why you've been so stressed out all the time?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Maeby," Have I been? You know what, I'm a kid. I'm going to start acting like one."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael," What, you're going to drink?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Maeby, Do you want to join me?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael," Well, I guess if you can run a studio."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, But they didn't know it was the fake wine from G.O.B.'s magic show.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael, It's good.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, And back in Iraq...
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., What is this?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster," Looks like a mid-range nuclear warhead. Has a range capacity of 4,000 to 5,000 nautical miles."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, You've got a pretty sophisticated knowledge of this technology.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B.," My God, it makes me want to have an ice-cream cone. Doesn't this make you want to have an ice-cream cone?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster, It does make me want to have an ice-cream cone.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Richard Shaw, You'll have plen of time for ice cream in prison. Ice cream sandwiches. CIA undercover.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, CIA. Of course. This explains why it was so easy to get you out of prison.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Richard Shaw, I knew that if he got out he would lead us right to whatever your dad was hiding.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, They'd even created opportunities for this to happen.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Prison Guard," Get in the cell, stupid."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., You... you... you're the one who didn't even shut the door. Come on!
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B.," Yeah, you guys can run this place without us. As soon as you stop dropping your keys. Come on!"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, They'd even staged something called an honor marathon they thought he was sure to take advantage of.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., Come on.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Richard Shaw, We've been looking for WMD's for years.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Saddam #4, WMD's? This thing is as fake as Achmed's mustache. See?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Yeah, look, it's a Homefill. It's the company that makes the fake stuff we fill the model homes with."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Richard Shaw, What the hell?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," What is that, a recording device?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Richard Shaw," This is our stuff. Okay, I got to call this in."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Buster, please."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Baker," Baker. No, it doesn't sound like CIA East. I'll check with CIA West. Did we bug a house in Mamoon?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Richard Shaw, (Sighs.)
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael," Look, I'm Uncle Buster."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Maeby, (Laughing.)
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael, I'm sorry no one from the family came.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Maeby, Sometimes I wish I wasn't even part of the family.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael," No, don't... no... I've never wanted to say this... but you might not even be related to us."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Maeby, No.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael," 'Cause Gangee once said to me, your mom might not have ever even been pregnant with you."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Maeby," Okay, now you're just saying that to make me feel better."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,George Michael," No, I'm... I wouldn't. Everyone still loves you. Some more than others."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator," And perhaps it was the fake wine, but that was the night George Michael and Maeby went to second base."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, So my dad was a patsy?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Richard Shaw," We call them ""unintentional operations victims,"" but yes. We ran the whole operation through a British building company."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, And they contacted my dad for the plans. I can't believe it- after all of that he wasn't lying.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Richard Shaw," Look, we feel terrible because this is really our mistake. But I'm afraid I'm going to have to take you guys out."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, Take us out?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster, Where?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., I could really go for some Italian.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Saddam #2, There is an Olive Garden in Mamoon.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Saddam #4," I think he means to shoot you in the head. But please, at least let him look at the air-conditioning."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Sir, if you're worried about us talking, we will not say a word."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster," Well, don't be mad, but I have been sending the pictures from my cell phone to my friend."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael, He doesn't not know what he's saying... (To Buster.) You have?
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster, Uh...
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Well, who knows who she sent them to?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Richard Shaw," Yeah. Yeah, I get it."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Looks like you are a hero, Buster."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., We both are.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster, Well...
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Richard Shaw," Okay, looks like you got us. What can the U.S. government do for you?"
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,G.O.B., We're going to need some business class tickets home. And direct flights. None of this stopping in Phoenix bull bleep.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," And more importantly, maybe we can drop some of these treason charges against my father."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster, And I do believe there was some mention of some ice cream.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator," And so, with Operation Hot Brother a success, Our American heroes left Iraq."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Buster, Take Condoleeza Rice Lane. It's quicker.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development, Tobias gives his daughter the gift he'd stayed up all night making..."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Tobias," And here's a picture of your mother pregnant. And here's a whole series of your head starting to crown. Look at you- so full of wonder and shock. You still do it. And so does he! Boy, you guys really are related."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Narrator, ... and Michael and G.O.B. make an interesting discovery.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Saddam, You've got the wrong guy. The real Saddam has a scar on his head. I'm no scar. I'm No scar.
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Michael," Oh, my God."
3,Exit Strategy,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Exit_Strategy,Saddam, Dot com.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator, This is Michael Bluth. Right now he's being honored by his family.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Three years ago, I made a choice to keep this family together... Uh, today looks like I succeeded."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator," So why is this man crying? Because now he'll have to stay with these people for a long, long time."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator," Days earlier, Michael awoke to find his son in his bed."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, Hey. Are you scared of a monster?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael, Kind of.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator," It was the monster called lust, to which he'd recently succumbed."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael, And there's a chance you might not even be related to us.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator," And although he'd only gotten to second base, he'd gone in head-first, like Pete Rose. But the next day, they both got some distressing news."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Tobias," And there you are, Maeby, coming out of your mother's third base. You guys really are related."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator, And that night..
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Maeby, You're not sleeping in here now.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael," Yeah, you think that's a bad idea?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Maeby," What, I mean, so we can make out every night?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael," Does that... not work for your schedule? I mean, I'm sure we can control our, you know... I'm going to go sleep with my dad."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Maeby," Yeah, I'm going to go get my job back."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, You're probably just a little anxious because your old man is about to start running a successful company for a change.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael," So Pop-Pop is definitely innocent, huh?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," No, not by a long shot but they have dropped all the charges, and not just the Iraq ones. The embezzlement, the pension-robbing... I don't know why they dropped them, but they did. Let's see if we are on Mad Money, huh?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," It's probably on right after this ad. This is going to be great for us, too. It's going to give us a chance to spend some time together, you know? It's like I don't even know what's going on in your life right now. Are there any girls or...?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael, Actually... I've been wrestling with some pretty taboo...
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, Shh-shh! Do you hear this?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, Risky! There it is!
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," We're doing it, huh? Are you happy?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael," I'm really happy. Hey, I wonder if we should move out of town."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, What?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael," I feel like we've heard this whole ""out of the woods"" thing a lot, you know, and-and I just wouldn't mind..."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael, Family.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," I was going to say breakfast, but... why don't we go over to Gangee's, have a little of both. Later we can talk all this out, huh?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael," Well, I've heard that a couple times, too."

3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille," I'd like to make an announcement. We need to finish the party we started three years ago, finally name Michael CEO of a thriving company."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille," We'll prove to the world that nothing can tear apart e Bluth family. In fact, I've already rented the same boat."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Buster," Oh, I'm not comforble near the ocean since the seal attack. The ocean is my second biggest fear."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille," Good, don't come. I need to be rubbing elbows, not working your fork."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, We'll find a new venue.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille," Oh, and before I forget, no magic, G.O.B."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, Where is G.O.B.?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George," Oh, who knows? I don't even know where he lives."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Buster, He doesn't live at Michael's?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Tobias, I've always pictured him in a lighthouse.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, Doesn't really matter.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Mom, I'm just really flattered that you're willing to do this. And I was half worried that you'd all be eager to sell your shares and cash out."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay, W-We-we can do that?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Well, yeah, but Stan Sitwell's always had a wild hair to buy this business."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille, It's the only hair he's got. What? He's an alpaca.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, He has alopecia.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," And, Lindsay, you know, if we did sell, it would only mean, like, what $2 million each?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Buster," $2 million, ..."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Tobias," ..., $2 million, ..."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George," ..., $2 million..."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," It sounds like a lot more than it actually is. You know, you've already spent $1,200 on eggs. And that would be it forever. Keep in mind we are building something that is not only for our own kids; it's also for George Michael and Maeby's kids, too."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael," What? What? We can't have kids! What's the matter...? What are you...? I mean it's not even an option, really."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Well, eventually, you'll want to."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael," Sure, I may want to, you know, now. I-It doesn't matter. Either way, I won't do anything about it. Come on!"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille," Michael's right, and I for one will not go back to wondering whether there's going to be enough food on the table."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, Might want to start worrying about the table.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay," It's fine for you to say ""Don't sell,"" but I'm going to be 40 in three years, you know?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," You know, being twins, our birthdays are pretty close to one another."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay," Yeah, but a 40-year-old woman has as much a chance of getting married as does of getting attacked by a shark."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Buster," (Shrieks.) Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were going to say ""seal."""
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay, Or a seal.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Buster," Oh, God!"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Lindsay, you have nothing to worry about. You're a beautiful woman. Any man would be lucky to have you."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator, Michael had given this speech many times to Lindsay.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Young Lindsay," I'm a giant, fat pig."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Young Michael 3, I don't know why you say stuff like that. Girls just grow faster than boys.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille, Dinner's ready. We're having Lindsay chops. What? I want her to be prepared in case some bully at school is as clever as I am.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator, No bully ever would be.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, you're already married.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George," Hey, Mikey."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, Yes?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George," I think I'm going to cash out myself and, uh, maybe go down to my little place in Cabo."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," What little place in Cabo, Dad? What, did you build yourself a little hideout in case you needed to escape?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George, (Chuckles.) Of course not.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Well, I don't want you to worry, Dad. There's going to be plenty of money to be made from a business run honestly."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George," Oh... well, your mom's not going to allow for that. She'll do whatever it takes to get her way. You think the banana stand was our idea?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, It wasn't?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George, Your mother said she'd take care of it. The guy was deported to Korea the next day.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator, Where his business never recovered.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," You're trying to tell me that all your crimes, all your dishonesty-she was behind it all?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George," She's the queen, Michael. I was her king, but now it's you. She may appear all sweet and innocent and light, but she has a way of, uh, controlling your behavior, and I'm concerned about you because I do not want to see..."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille, He'll be fine.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George, You'll be fine.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator, Michael went to cancel the reservation on the party boat Buster so feared...
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, G.O.B.!
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, You might want to untie these ropes first.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,G.O.B.," Don't tell me how to flee, Michael."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, What are you doing here?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,G.O.B.," Well, I... kind of live here."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, Lighthouse wasn't far off.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, Perhaps you can tell me how you can afford a boat.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,G.O.B.," You mean on the, uh, paltry $1,500 a week you give me?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Uh, I give you $500 a week."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,G.O.B.," Yeah, well, somebody's drawing a little ""one"" on those checks."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,G.O.B., No big deal. I plan on using my Bluth Company stock to pay for it. Sitwell's made me a pretty nice little offer.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," About that, G.O.B.-you cannot sell now."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,G.O.B., I have to.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," G.O.B., you're going to burn through this money and have nothing, all right? ""You give a man a fish, he'll eat for a night. If you teach a man to fish..."""
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,G.O.B.," He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,G.O.B., I'm burning through my future for it. But you wouldn't understand that because you're a robot. Although I don't suppose you'd be willing to have the company buy it?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille," (On the phone.) Well, you can't let G.O.B. sell those shares."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Man, Just keep your weight off it.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille, So lease it to him through the company.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Yeah, that just doesn't feel right."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille," Oh, really? How would it feel to lose the company to a man who has less hair on his bleep than I have on my bleep?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, It can't be worse than hearing that just was.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille, Give G.O.B. the boat. We need to show the shareholders at this party that the family is united. It's a very small concession to a important cause.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator, And so Michael sold out just a little.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael," Hey, Dad."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Hey, pal."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael," Well, you said we could... we could talk later."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, Yeah. You excited about the party?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael, I actually might even just skip that.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," What are you talking about? This party is essential for the stockholders to see. I mean, we got to show them how close this family really is."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator, And this was as good an opening as George Michael was going to get.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael, Maeby and I made out.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, I'm sorry?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael," Me, too."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," What-what do you mean, son? You kissed?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael," Even a little more than that. I thought she wasn't my real cousin, but then Uncle Tobias showed us these really rough pictures that proved that she was really Aunt Lindsay's daughter. I just feel like I can't be around her or Aunt Lindsay. They were really rough... pictures."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael," I mean, I know it's wrong, you know, but, uh, my feelings are real even... even if it was a mistake."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Well, obviously, acting on those feelings is not an option. She's a blood relative."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael, I know. I've seen the blood.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Now, how long has this been going on?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,George Michael," I don't know. 53 weeks? I can't be around her with these feelings anymore, and that's why I'm-I'm not going to this party."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator, And so Michael made another compromise of his values for the sake of the business.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Whatever happened to that Ann we were both so crazy about? You know, maybe you can bring her to the party. Yeah... Ann is the girl for us."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator," Michael's sister, meanwhile, was doing some selling out of her own."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay," ... that I'm not going to sell my five percent, even though you haven't made an offer... which would be how much, by the way?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Stan Sitwell, Five percent? Lucille actually gave you less than her natural children?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay," I hope that's not a crack about my hair color, lips, forehead, nose and teeth. Because at least I'm not wearing a rayon sweater set on my face."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Stan Sitwell," It's alpaca, actually. Cruelty-free really narrows your choices."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Stan Sitwell," But that's not what I meant when I said ""natural child."""
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay," Wait a minute, you're saying... I'm adopted?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Stan Sitwell, I'm sorry. I thought you knew. Have I upset you?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Stan Sitwell," You were almost a Sitwell, but 37 years ago, the Bluths adopted you out from under us. So we said good-bye to you-our darling little three-year-old..."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay," Uh, wait, ""three-year-old""? Uh, you said it was 37 years ago."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Stan Sitwell," Oh, yeah, right. Hey, we should do something for your 40th next week."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator, This part of the news Lindsay didn't take that well.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay, Let me bleep. Get your bleep hands...
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Stan Sitwell, Be gentle! She's almost 40!
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Maeby, Please don't fire me.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator," Michael had compromised his morals, and was having trouble sleeping. Of course, some of that was Lindsay."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, Are you drunk?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay, A little. We need to talk.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Yeah, I'll say. Are you aware that your daughter and my son have been getting physical? I mean, can you imagine anything that inappropriate?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay, (Climbs on top of Michael.)
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, Whoa. I guess you can. What're you doing?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay, I'm not your sister.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, What?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay, I'm adopted.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Wait, Lindsay..."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay, And I'm three years older.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Hey, there must be some mistake."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay, No. Mom confirmed it. And I know you've always found me attractive. You've been telling me that for the last 40 years.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Wait, Lindsay. This is crazy."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay," If I don't get divorced and remarry in the next month, I'm going to sell those shares, and I'm gonna cash out. So, what do you say?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator, But even Michael couldn't sell out that much.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, I'm just not that into older women.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lindsay, You bastard!
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator," Michael had just found out his sister was adopted. And the next morning, he awoke to a worse surprise."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Oh, come on."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Tobias," Well, I can't sleep in the same room as her. She wants out of this marriage, fine. I-I'm afraid I'm going have to sell the Bluth shares and move on."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, You can't do that.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Tobias, They're my shares.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," No, I mean, you can't spoon me like that."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Tobias, Oh.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," We need a new venue for the shareholders' party, and it cannot be a boat. Now, if you can find something, maybe I can fudge the books, get you a Bluth Company salary, huh? Maybe call you an events coordinator."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Tobias, Can we just lay here for a second while I think about it?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator, Michael was making compromises all over the place.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, Sure.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Tobias, I'll do it.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, Sounds great.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Narrator," Soon, George Michael went to Ann's to try to win her back. But her Uncle Paul told him that Ann had moved in with her boyfriend. He also mentioned that we all only had three more weeks on earth, and that fossils were just something the Jews buried in 1924. And so, feeling that he couldn't go home, George Michael decided to seek out his own creepy uncle, and Michael confronted his mother about the adoption."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille," Look, she was better off with us. He wanted to call her Nellie."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, Of course. Lindsay is the Nellie from the photo. Why didn't you just tell people that she was adopted?
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille," Adopting a child we didn't want just to stick it to a competitor. Well, that'd make us look great."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," You're right, Mom. People would have twisted that story to make you look bad."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille, I don't see what the big deal is. We loved her just as much as any of you normal kids. More than G.O.B.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," The big deal, Mom, is that the family is falling apart. They're trying to sell their stock, and I can't promise you that I can keep everyone together until the party."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille," We'll pay them off. We'll call it an accrued cash dividend, but they won't get their money until sign a document at the party promising not to sell for ten years."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," So, it's embezzlement, bribery and conspiracy?"
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Lucille, And a whole lot of love.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Oh, yeah, and perjury."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Tobias," Oh, Michael."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, Hey. Oh.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Buster, (Gasps.) Queen Mary? That's a ship!
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Tobias," Oh, no, no, no. It's a chain of popular nightclubs. Although I haven't been to this particular location. It's on the Long Beach Harbor."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Buster, That's the ship.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael," Buster, don't worry about it. They've actually welded it to the dock."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Tobias," Although, perhaps I should call the ""Hot Cops"" and tell them to come up with something more nautically themed. Hot Sailors. Better yet, Hot Seam..."
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Michael, I like Hot Sailors.
3,Development Arrested,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Development_Arrested,Tobias," Hmm. Me, too."

4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Young Lucille, So we will stick together and have all of our meetings on boats.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Herb Zuckerkorn," Well, I don't know if that's necessary."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Young Barry," Yeah, because they don't have to be together, because you can't try a husband and wife for the same crime, right?"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Herb Zuckerkorn, Sure.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"Young George, Sr.", We have the best (BLEEP) attorneys.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Michael, You think we should go back?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", Absolutely. She's your mother. Family has to stick together. You're afraid she'll turn on you. Won't even leave the table during a dinner party.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Michael," Okay. We're going back, George Michael!"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator," It turned out Lucille had returned to shore, too."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,John Beard, (On TV) Why the alleged ship-jacker changed direction is still unexplained.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator, And soon the family met up at the beginning of a fourth season…
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," My wife, how is she?"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator, …that would never come.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Coast guardsman," She's fine. You're lucky we didn't have an autumn, otherwise she'd be colder."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille," Look what they've done, George! Look what the homosexuals have done to me."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille, A joyride. That's what they decide to do with the freedom this country has given them.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille," That's the best alibi I've been able to come up with, because our lawyer says he thinks he can get rid of the SEC charges, But he's worried about the pirating of the Queen Mary. Says they have a suit against us."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", Where is Barry?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille, He's with the harbormaster. He's trying to dazzle them with a suit of his own.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Barry," Well, he hated the suit. Thought I was making fun."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Barry," But basically, this is a good news / bad news deal."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Barry," First of all, won't be cheap. It's gonna cost you a fortune in legal fees."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", What's the good news?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Barry," Oh, yeah. From your perspective, I can see where you think it's all bad news. It's all bad news."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Barry," Also, it turns out that stealing the Queen Mary comes under maritime law, which, I just found out, is an actual thing. It's a real thing. Don't you worry. We got three months to prepare for this hearing."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator," And so, George Sr. went to his competitor, Stan Sitwell, with an offer, so he could afford to cover Lucille's high legal fees."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Stan Sitwell," Buy the rest of your stock? You got to be kidding me. I already dumped the stock I owned to Lucille Austero. Don't forget, I was on that boat. And believe me, I lost more than just the 50 grand on that sale. I also lost a perfectly good pair of human chest hair nipple tufts when we hit the water."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator," Stan Sitwell suffered from alopecia, a condition that rendered him hairless."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Stan Sitwell, That's kelp. Why would I put it onto my chest or head or anywhere else?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Stan Sitwell, I was gonna show those babies off at the Jacuzzi after-party.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," Come on, Stan. I'm offering you the chance to double the size of your business."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Stan Sitwell," Way ahead of you. I've got a big project coming up. And even you can't compete for this one, with your business in the shape that it's in. This is a biggie. I get this contract, and it gets government approval, I'll be bigger than Halliburton. Well, maybe not Halliburton, but definitely Halliburton Teen."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator," Halliburton Teen was a leading youth and lifestyle retailer, despite the fact that it was a rebranding of the tarnished Halliburton Penitentiary and Rendition Systems."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator, It's also how their deep-water drilling enterprise spawned this company.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Stan Sitwell," Anyway, you're too late. The contract is practically mine. Even you can't underbid me."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," Well, you may have a bigger business than me, but you will never have this. And believe me, I'm gonna find out that project you're working on, even if I have to search the public records for the blueprints myself."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Stan Sitwell," Well, unless you search in this office, you will never find them."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", Oh! Ahh! Ow! My hair! My beautiful hair!
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Stan Sitwell, My hair! My beautiful hair!
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Stan Sitwell, This isn't what it looks like!
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," Oh, really? Because it looks like a monument to George W. Bush."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Stan Sitwell," Well, you got me. You're in for a rude awakening, Sitwell. It'll never stand. It's too thin. It'll never stand."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," You see the ""W's. and the word ""Bush."" I mean, what else could it be?"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille, You mean other than a 20-foot-wide monument that goes five miles into the sky?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," I know, I know. And I told him it wouldn't stand, which I probably shouldn't have."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille," It's a wall, George. You're looking at it sideways. The ""W"" stands for ""Wall."" The bushes…"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," Stand for the bushes. Ah! This explains the immigration booth 10,000 feet in the air."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille," It's to separate the U.S. and Mexico, to keep out the immigrants, which was my idea!"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", Was your idea. I remember. You said that right after Lupe got the bleach stain on your teal blazer.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille," How did you miss this, George? This is business we should have. Is this how you're going to let it all end, as a failure? Is that your plan?"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", No. Of course not.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator, It was his plan.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator, George Sr. felt discouraged and alone.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," Bluth for two… I mean, one."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Maitre d’, I thought I already seated you.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator, When he saw a familiar face…
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator, His own.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator, On his twin brother Oscar.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar," George! Actually, we came in to use the bathroom, but they sat me. And they have mahi-mahi today. Will you join us? Will you have a mahi-mahi on me?"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar, On you.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," Fine, but I'm gonna sit opposite you, so it won't look bad."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar," These are my friends, we all live in the desert together."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar, This is Heartfire. She's an aura specialist. She did Matthew Modine.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar, I will.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar, Heartfire would like some more crackers.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," Oscar, you don't believe that nonsense, do you?"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Doctor Norman," No, no, no. You're a skeptic. But I'll tell you something, the desert changes you."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar, Doctor Norman is a disgraced anesthesiologist.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Doctor Norman," Oh… The bigger crime would've been the patient didn't wake up and testify against me. But nobody cares about the part of the oath he kept. I'll tell you this. If that nastiness had never happened, I never would've gotten those prison pen pal letters from the most beautiful woman in the world."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,China Garden," IF HE AS BAD AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAY HE IS, THEN WHY DID I FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM? HUH? YO (BLEEP) THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA! (BLEEP) THEM! BUNCH OF CAL-I-FOR-NI-A (BLEEP) YEAH."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Doctor Norman," As you can imagine, her letters really stood out. Do you know China Garden?"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," I know the downtown one. You know, I shouldn't judge."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," 'Cause you have friends, and I… I envy that."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar," You're welcome to my friends, brother."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", I don't want these.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator," But perhaps due to the absence of Lucille, the two brothers connected as they hadn't in years."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", I'm not the big man I thought I was.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar," Forget the past, George. I don't know, maybe it's because I live on the border between the United States and Mexico and…"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", Hold on. Border?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar," You don't think I live like this all the time, do you? That's why I had so much fun at that party on the Queen Mary."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar, And you paid for my haircut.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar, And you made me dress like you.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", Forget the past. What were you saying about that property on the border?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator, And that's when George Sr. saw the desert property and the much smaller sweat lodge that was on the land.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", You live here?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,China Garden, ASK HIM!
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Doctor Norman, Would you like to watch us make love?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", No. You live here?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar," We have been. You see, Mexico starts right at the end of that gully, and we have to get in and out of there so we can get at the maca root."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", What the hell is maca root?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar, It's an ancient Aztec power herb.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Doctor Norman," It's an endocrine adaptogen. It's legal to grow in Mexico, but it's against the law to consume it there. Of course, you can ingest it here, but you can't grow it."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar," And you can bring it into Mexico, but you can't bring it out."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Doctor Norman," So, it's. uh, hard."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", So you guys are knowingly breaking the law?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar," But it's worth it, because maca has powerful properties, especially when combined with an hour in the sweat lodge. It gets up to 110 degrees in there."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", Sounds fun.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar, Oh! But you have to do it with us. You'll find a power you didn't know you had.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar," But, you want to do it soon, because they're kicking us off of the land. (sobs) I'm sorry."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Doctor Norman," Oh, great. Now you're gonna make me cry. Oh! Lizard! Look! Look, a lizard!"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,China Garden, CUTE!
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", What if I were to buy this land?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar, I don't understand. Why would you want to do that?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," Well, I always talk about being a great man. Maybe a way to do that is not by being the biggest businessman in Southern California, it's."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar, …it's by being the best brother in Southern California.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator," George Sr. was going to say, ""…by gouging the government when they needed the land"""
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", You bet.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar," Hey, guys, we're staying. Oh, thank you, brother."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator, But he'd save that for Lucille.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar," Thank you, maca."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,China Garden," THANK YOU, MACA!"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", And I can get this land for a song.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator, George was proud of his plan. Are you listening to me?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille," So are those cameras, George. We can't use the same cameras from when he was under house arrest?"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Workman, These are from the maritime penal system. They make us use the waterproof ones.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille, In here.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", Okay.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," We're gonna sell that land to the government for Sitwell's wall, and I'm gonna take the cash. I am gonna mount a case that shows that my wife is not the power-hungry monster the SEC wants to make her out to be."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille, You're such a puny thinker.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", Am I puny-thinking again?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille, Sitwell's wall? How about our wall? We build the wall.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", We do have the plan.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille," He says he can build it for 200 million, we offer to build it for 150 million, and we make up the difference when we sell the land."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", And I use that cash as a little stimulus for us.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille, Maybe a little something for the family.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", And we build that sucker…
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille, That's my Georgie!
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", …five miles high.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", Long. Five miles long.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", I got nothing in my system but a maca root cookie.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Workman," So, that one's all set. Uh… Can I put one up there?"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", Only if you want to see the sexiest video you've ever seen.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", Sorry I gave you the old noodle stab in there. I needed something in my system.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille," You know, we can't look like we're in cahoots on this. Especially with my trial coming up."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," Yeah, that's right. We have to separate our assets. To protect this. To protect our love."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator, And that's when they got the idea to pretend they were getting a divorce.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", We're getting a divorce.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Buster, (screams)
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Michael, I want to know about the stimulus package.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," We haven't had sex since Christmas, Michael!"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Buster," I'm… I'm sorry. You had sex seven weeks ago? They were remodeling my room, and I pulled my cot in there, just like camp."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille, We yelled at you to leave.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Buster," Yeah, but then you whispered, ""Don't pull out!"""
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,G.O.B., Arrrrrrgh!
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Michael, You didn't want to use any of that money for…
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,G.O.B., Ohhhh!
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Michael, You couldn't use any of that money to finish Sudden Valley?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator, And although their plan was dealt a minor setback when Michael sold the controlling shares to Lucille 2…
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Michael," You know what? I am done with this family. I hope you've saved some money, 'cause you're gonna need every dime now."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator, …all they had to do was keep their plan a secret from her and cash in quickly.

4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," Although, at times, I do wish it were darker."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar," It's too bad you don't have time to try this. Yesterday, I was talking to a lizard, and it turned into Elizabeth Taylor."

4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," I don't know what you saw, but I got an ostrich and no boner."

4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Barry, I thought you were going to sell the land to the government to build a wall.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," Yeah, but that was put on hold."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Barry, So? it's election time. Now's the time to get a politician to push for the wall. Isn't that dizzy kook Lucille Austero running?
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," No, no, she can't know about this. She's the majority owner of my company, and besides, she's so pro-immigrant."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator," She was. She'd even taken in a Latino foster child, which she denied was an attempt to bring in the Hispanic vote."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator," Nonetheless, she did know what cultural buttons to push to win their hearts."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Barry," Doesn't matter, she's not going to win anyway. The guy you want is the guy she's running against. Herbert Love, right? He's got a rally tonight. Go and see him. Everyone knows how persuasive you can be."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," Used to be. I'd be lucky to sell a glass of lemonade for $1,000 today."

4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Barry," …and turn it into a net worth of $750,000… Before, of course, what I owe in lawsuits, you can talk a politician into wasting public funds on a wall."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," Wait, wait, that rally is tonight?"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Barry, Mmm-hmm.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," But I'm supposed to meet my wife tonight, which I am dreading, by the way."

4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille, You're so ugly from behind.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," 'Cause if no one shows up at that office, she really will divorce me."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Barry," Too bad you can't use a double. Oh, also, I used a look-alike named Stewart to take the California bar for me. But you knew that, right?"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr.", Oscar.

4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar, Maybe I had a better offer. And not a word to Doctor Norman.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,China Garden," He doesn't think women should be awake for it. ""Oh, great, Doctor Norman."""

4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," Whoa, we don't have to yell."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,China Garden," WHY NOT YOU GO DO HOT SWEAT, LET OSCAR DO SQUEEZE?"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar," All right, I mean, I'm not saying that. I just… I need a break."

4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,"George, Sr."," It's funny you should say that because if you're okay with the sitting silently part, I have something for you that's quite chilling."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar, Thank you.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator," And so George Sr. left to seek out the right-wing politician Herbert Love as Oscar headed out to visit Lucille, disguised as George, which is exactly who Barry thought he was talking to."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Barry, I just pooped in a hole and covered it up. I hope I did the right thing.
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar, There's a commode. It's directly up hill from the maca root.

4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Barry," Very good, George. We got to be careful where we talk about this. I got to watch my words."
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Narrator, And that's when Oscar realized that George Sr. didn't buy the land to be the best brother in Southern California.

4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Lucille," Have you baked your brain in that pizza oven, or is senility your backup plan if we can't get the government to buy the property?"
4,Borderline Personalities,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Borderline_Personalities,Oscar," So we only did buy that land for personal gain. Well, what Oscar doesn't know won't hurt him."

4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lucille," They are persecuting me. It was an accident. This is ridiculous! If I'd told them we were taking a bunch of gays out there to get married, they'd have thrown me a parade. Let's tell them we were taking a bunch of gays to get married."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Yeah, I don't think your record on that issue is going to back that up, Mom."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," In fact, it was an issue of the Bay Window magazine that would most damage her with the gay community."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lucille, Fine. We'll say they took it on a joyride. And you have no right to criticize me. At least I was able to turn my Queen around.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, None taken.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, This is Tobias Fünke

4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lucille, Adopted daughter. And that's not true.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Coast guardsman," Could I have the Bluth family over here, please? And over here, the victims of the Bluth family?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," And that's when Lindsay found a label more fitting than ""Bluth."""
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," No, Lindsay, you're going to the wrong area. Kenny, Chet, Curtis, Mike, Bix, and Gator are over here. We should be over here at the Bluth area with Gob and Buster and, uh…"

4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," (sings) Is that a gal I see? No, it's just a fallacy"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, We loved that. Where's that from?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," It's from nothing. But it made her realize this, too."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," I don't know if there's a right time to say this, but this marriage of ours, it hasn't been working. Yeah, there's nothing keeping us together."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, I believe we're thinking the same thing.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Yeah, we should end it."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, Let's give it another shot.... to the head. Kill it. Yes.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," Lindsay was looking for inspiration before she set out on her new path. And it only took until the ""Pray"" section of Eat, Pray, Love for her to find it."

4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," Soon, she was beginning a journey - to reinvent herself."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Oh! I'm doing it again. I have to let go of these material things.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, To leave the trappings of her old life and try to live with less.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, There.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, Her immersion into Indian culture began even before reaching the airport.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," And so this daily prayer, it connects one to the whole."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Cabbie," Yes, the whole of humanity. Yes."

4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," And they have normal toilets, right?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," And after an hour or so with SkyMall, where she was proud of herself for only buying two things, a self-cleaning litter box in case she ever got a cat, and an inflatable hat box in case she ever got a hat, she got to a great article in the in-flight magazine and found herself filling up with inner peace and acceptance."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," I mean, not right away."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, What is she doing back there?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," That passenger had been pushing on her seat for, like, four hours."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, Lindsay's journey to let go of her baggage got off to a bad start at baggage claim when she picked up the wrong baggage.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, And her Western notions of the value of life were challenged on the bus ride to the hotel.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Oh!
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Oh, my God. Did we just hit something? Shouldn't we stop?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Bus passenger, No. It wasn't a cow. It was just a tourist.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, And that's how Lindsay's path to living with less…
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Wait. This isn't my…
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, How am I supposed to find out who I really am dressed like this chick?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, …took a brief detour into a shopping spree - at India's famous Mall Mountain.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," It's cute on me. But I thought it was supposed to say ""Kate."""
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Jaideep," Oh, no, anything under a small is considered a David Spade."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Veejay, I love this jacket. I'll give you 60 for it. Best coat on the mountain.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay,65
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Veejay, 70! It'd look great on my wife or my sickly son.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, 100 bucks. Yes!
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Jaideep," $100, yes. That is the best jacket on the mountain for $100."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," And soon, she was back at the hotel and ready for her spiritual experience."

4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Female Concierge," It's hard to tell because there are so many people in it, but yes, it is a pool."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Well, yeah, by the pool, then. And, um, do you think you can get someone to remove the smell of lamb from my room?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Male Concierge, Of course. And which animal smell would you prefer?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Female Concierge, Which do you prefer?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator,00 p.m. shaman…
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Shaman Sheman, You are living a life without love.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, …Lindsay got a deeper treatment than she had hoped for.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," How do I learn to be happy? You know, to love?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Shaman Sheman," When love is near your heart, you'll be happy. You must live life truthfully."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Yeah, no, I do live truthfully, but I'm just so full of passion."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Shaman Sheman, You are so full of (BLEEP).
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Yeah, yeah. Although, in my culture, ""full of (BLEEP)"" is kind of like a dig. I mean, you'd never say it to a customer. But yeah, no, I know what you mean."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Shaman Sheman, This bag is as fake as you are.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Well, how do I learn?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Shaman Sheman, Just look at the spelling.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," God. No, I…"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Shaman Sheman, Pull your head out of the sand. Love is where you left it.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, You mean back home? God. The only person back home is Tobias.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Shaman Sheman, You have no children?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, Lindsay thought she was being hit on.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," No. Why do you ask? Wait a minute. You're saying I've come halfway around the world to find out I need to go back home? God, I haven't even gone to the beach yet."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, She had. It was just too crowded to see the water.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," It was a moving experience, but after leaving the tent, it wasn't just the shaman's words that got through to her."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Excuse me. I'd like to talk about my shaman appointment. Specifically, what is your policy on damaged…"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, It was this.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Male Concierge, I'm sorry. Your AmEx was declined. Your account is maxed out. We had to cancel your shaman appointment.

4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Male Concierge, (yells at ostrich) Get out! Get out! Go away!
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Male Concierge, Get out! Get out! Get out!
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Male Concierge," I'm sorry to yell at you, but as I said, it was declined. So get out."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," But, fortunately, the universe offered a solution to her financial problem that wasn't too far off from what her shaman had said."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lucille," (on phone) Oh, I've got money for you, sweetie, but it means my loving daughter smiling next to her husband sitting behind me at the trial."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Would you take a grimace?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," So it was with this dual intention that she reached out to a husband she'd left behind, with a new sense of inner peace."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," Of course, there was still some outer stuff she needed to work through."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, I'm ready to make this work.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, It was with a sense of enlightenment that Lindsay returned from her spiritual journey.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Michael, …returned from her spiritual journey…
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Michael," To get her hands on the stimulus money, too, right?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Michael," Stop with the prayer hands. It just looks like you're out of ideas. Seriously, shoot me if you ever catch me doing that."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Says the least spiritual man I know.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Michael, What deal did you strike with her? What part of her soul did you buy?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lucille, All I've asked is that she testify that I was a wonderful mother who did her best.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Michael, So all of it.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," No, Michael. I'm not a whore. I don't get any of the money until after I do the disgusting thing. But I'm not here just for the stimmy. I'm here because a shaman told me that love is where I left it. Which, after much soul searching and by process of elimination, is Tobias."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, I got the part.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," And so Lindsay and Tobias took another shot at being husband and wife. And although they wouldn't have money until after the perjury, they set about buying a home."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,James Carr, Are you ready to make a move?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," As you can see, I'm ready for a lot that's new."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,James Carr," Oh! Good heavens! Right! Well, this is a great area. There's some wonderful surgi-centers nearby."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, We're doing it. We're really doing this.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,James Carr, Yes! We're gonna get you in the right house. And it's just the two of you? You have no children?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, We don't.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, We should be honest here. We have no income flow. No incoming income flow. We have plenty of outgoing income.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," No savings, no credit. I mean, we had some stimmy, but that went to his hospital bills. But there's one thing we do have…"

4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Right. No work ethic. But there's one thing we do have, we do have a daughter. I was just on auto-pilot before, when I said we didn't."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," I should have caught that, yeah, but…"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Maeby," I could've spoken up, but I just wanted to see if you guys got there."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,James Carr," Well, you guys seem like a great family. We have to be realistic. I'm in the real estate business. It's 2006. That's all good enough for me. We're gonna put you in a NINJA loan. ""No income, no jobs, no assets."" And you don't have to pay a penny for two years."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," Oh, NINJA, please! So we'll take something cozy and intimate. A one-bedroom."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Or bigger.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,James Carr," Yeah, how about something nice? A three-bedroom?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Three does sound bigger.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," Oh, it definitely is."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, You have to remember that this was a time when banks were eager to create as much debt as possible.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," The five-bedroom, four-car garage."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,James Carr," And I know that you guys are going to be okay with just one master bathroom, because a lot of people do prefer two. You know, they like to just have it."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Maybe separate, so we have it."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, So we have it. That way we have it.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,James Carr, That way you have it.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, Do you think we really need one?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,James Carr," I'm just gonna interrupt for a second. You don't need a wine cellar, if you want to do wine tastings in your butler's kitchen."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," I mean, this really isn't what we discussed."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," Well, we didn't discuss any of this, but, uh, yes, I guess, that way, we have it."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Well, yeah…"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,James Carr," That way, you'll definitely have it. And then once you have it, that way, you'll have it."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, But do we need a gatehouse?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,James Carr," I just put John Beard into a house with a double gatehouse. Now, that's John Beard, he's on television. No one's gonna look down on you just 'cause you have less than John Beard."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, Is this crazy?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, I think so. We'll take the double gatehouse.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," Oh, is that what you thought?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,James Carr," Well, that way, we'll have it."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, We have it.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,James Carr," And that way, you have it."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, There was a lot of this going on back then.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,James Carr," This way, we have it."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," And soon, they were starting their new life in their new beautiful home."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Mother's Day eve was the most joyous day of the year. Maeby, you're gonna be late for school."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, And what they lost in coziness…
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," God, they grow up so slowly."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, …they made up for in cavernous…
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, And the robot's dead again.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, …unfurnished space.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, Uh… Poor little guy. Ran out of juice before he could reach his…
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," With her mother's trial coming up, Lindsay made an effort to work on her testimony."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," ""…when I was hungry, I…"""
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lucille, Go on.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," You don't want me to say this next part, do you?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lucille, I think it tells the story.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," But am I accidentally being funny, or am I purposely being funny?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lucille, It's not supposed to be funny.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," ""Suckled at her champagne glass breasts"" isn't a joke?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lucille, Buster wrote it.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Recently?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lucille, I adapted it from a letter he wrote from camp.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Young Buster," I miss you, Mommy. Camp is scary at times. When I was cold, you clothed me. When I was hungry… Uh… How do I say this?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Young Lucille, Suckled at your champagne glass breasts.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Young Buster," Oh, that's good."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Young Lucille," It doesn't matter. I'll be proofing it, anyway."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, God. This is from Camp Kiss-A-Me-Mommy?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lucille, Just read the copy. You're getting paid for this.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, No. You know what? The money is not important to me. My shaman said…
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lucille," Oh, don't give me that mystical nonsense. You think you're better than I am, but you're a lot more like me than you think you are."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lucille," Now, let's take it from, ""I hope she gives me bubble baths forever."" And I want to smell the suds."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, But worse news was around the corner.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,John Beard, (On TV) The collapse of the California housing market is taking a personal toll with…
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Uh-oh!
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,John Beard," …layoffs here at the station. In addition, I'm leaving the keys to my 10,000-square-foot home in Harbor Shallows here on the desk…"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," Well, it probably shouldn't affect our area. He's over by where the fountain is."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,John Beard," Might I say to them, good luck getting that (BLEEP) raccoon smell out of the gatehouse, because I never could."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," But you and I are okay, right? I mean, this works, right?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, Never better.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," And the week of Lucille's trial, they got some even worse news."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, What's this? Mother's not going to pay?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, She actually said she'd only pay me if my testimony is believable.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, Lindsay! Lindsay!
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," But how am I supposed to say something like, ""I love you, Mother,"" and sound believable?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," Look, Jesus… Jesus C. Penny! I wish I had the luxury of not sounding believable. But that's not an option for an out-of-work actor, is it?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Or it's why you're out of work!
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," Well, I beg one's pardon, but I have been dying to go to that Method Acting Clinic that I see on my nightly drives, but you won't let me!"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Because you already wasted all that money on Carl Weathers' Master Acting Class.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," Well, I'm sorry, but I'm such a star (BLEEP) that I didn't pay attention to anything he said!"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Oh, well, then, maybe I should go to your Method Acting Class to make my testimony more believable!"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, That's actually a good idea. Maybe you could…
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, Oh! Hi. Yes.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," Well, perhaps we should go together."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Yeah. Might be good for us, as a couple."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, I do hope so. I really want to make this work.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Me, too. I really love you, Tobias."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," Oh, Lindsay, we have got to get you to that acting clinic."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, And that was with me picturing fudge.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, Fudge.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," To bond with her husband and prepare for her testimony, Lindsay had decided to attend an acting class with Tobias."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, This is the first time I've actually done something like this with you. I think I always kind of looked down on it.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," You know Lindsay, I think you'll find that some of what used to seem clueless about me is actually something I'm quite good at. This is where I belong."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Clinic supervisor," If you're new here, you need to go to the window. Fill out this form first. And there's some personal questions on it, like how you first got hooked."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," Well, that's an easy one. You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown. No, Mame. No, ma'am… You're A Good Man… You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Woman on stage, Would you like to start?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, Gypsy. Gypsy.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Woman on stage, Just come up here and be as truthful as possible.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,DeBrie," Okay, this is (BLEEP) overwhelming."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Buster," Oh, they're starting the monologues."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,DeBrie, I've been clean for three hours…
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, I think this is from Songs for My Father.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,DeBrie," and I'm like this (BLEEP) is (BLEEP) up, right?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, What did you say the name of this acting class was again?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, Method One Clinic.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Okay, I'm gonna go get coffee."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, Garden Grove Method One Clinic.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," And moments later, as Lindsay, once again, found herself questioning her husband's choices, one of hers was questioned."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," That's not Free Trade, and if it's not Free Trade, it's (BLEEP). I wouldn't."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, You don't look like a junkie.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," You do. What do you weigh, like, 90 pounds?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," That's so funny! Oh, God, um, thank you. But no, no. If I'm addicted to anything, it's alcohol. I'm Lindsay. And you're ""Biteme."""
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," No, I don't like giving my name to any state organization, especially after I got kicked off the voter rolls, 'cause I accidentally signed up for the wrong political group."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, What group was that?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, I don't even remember. Just some guy in a booth on the boardwalk.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, He joined al-Qaeda.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, And I only signed up 'cause he was giving away a free beard brush.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," That says ""al-Qaeda"" on it. But maybe he thought it was the designer of the brush."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, I'm Marky Bark.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Of the tree-freer Barks?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," Marky was the son of Johnny Bark, an activist that Lindsay had once helped save, and then kill, a tree."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Oh, my God! I remember him! I remember thinking, one day, he was just gonna fall out of a tree and break his neck. Whatever happened to him?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, He fell out of a tree and broke his neck.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Oh, God…"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," No, I'm just kidding."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Oh! So how is he?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," Oh, he's dead. But natural causes. A bunch of deranged bees chased him out of a tree and he fell to his death."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," So, are you here alone, or…"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," No, I'm with her. She's a committee member."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Which committee is that?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, Itty-bitty (BLEEP).
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, What a wonderful sense of humor.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," Listen, the only time DeBrie can keep food down is for about 20 minutes after she comes crashing off the methadone, so would you care to join us as we rustle up some grub to shove down our mouths?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, I would like that very much.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, So Tobias and Lindsay drove to meet their new friends for lunch.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, They are such a neat couple!
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, Are they neat? It's so fun to have another couple to go out with.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," He's amazing. I mean, so passionate about real issues. He's a real activist, like me."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," And she's a real actress, like me! Oh, she used to be in big movies, but then, like a lot of actors, the teeth go… But she is the perfect age to be a Hollywood actress, 42."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Is that all? Oh, I think this is the place. It's a barter restaurant. Marky doesn't believe in money."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, Do I like Barter?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," No, it means they don't deal with money. That's why I swiped that methadone tray."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, Hmm. What interesting friends we've made.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, I think this is exactly what our marriage needed.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, Lindsay and Tobias gathered with their new friends…
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Loretta," Hi, y'all! This your first time…"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, …at C.W. Swappigan's. a chain that sprung up after the economic collapse.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Loretta," …at C.W. Swappigan's. Well, we are like a Salvation Army meets a soup kitchen, meets a gastro pub, meets a Marxist-or Leninist-type social structure. These are things that you can order and these are things that we will accept. As you see on the bottom, we don't have the fish, and we're not taking any more lava lamps. Uh-oh, I can see this one's got that deer-in-the-headlights look!"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Oh, no. He just took some methadone. He thought he was driving with a cocktail tray. Speaking of that, how about mozzarella sticks for the table?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Loretta," Cocktail tray, light scratching, for mozzarella sticks."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Counter Man," Six, no sauce."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, And maybe some sparkling water for the table.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Loretta," Oh, I'm sorry, sir. We're no longer taking hotel soaps."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, This is fun.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, A lot of people couldn't handle a dumpster dive for their first double date.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Is that what this is?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," Now, wait a second. I wasn't driving?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, It's just so refreshing to meet people with real passion about changing the status quo.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, Lindsay and I don't have a single friend.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,DeBrie," Is the food here yet? I'm not hungry, but, uh… Oh, look, it's butter."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, DeBrie.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,DeBrie, Woooow!
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," DeBrie, that's our butter. We were going to swap it for dessert."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," No, she's improvising. Yes, ma'am. You seem to be liking that butter substitute at Swappigan's. Yes, and what else could you swap for? Uh, yes, and… Oh, I'm out. She's too good. I don't know who my guy is. I don't have a guy."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," No, she just likes butter. Come on, let's get you cleaned up. Don't touch anything."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias," Marky, I'll take her. You two just got here. Have a chat about. I'll clean her up. Come on, DeBrie."

4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Don't be. I love it here. My mother would hate this place.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," You know, Lindsay, I have to tell you, when I first met you, I thought you were one of those typical, uptight, snobby, Newport Beach, vapid…"

4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," You know, one of those monsters that lives in a 10,000-square-foot house that they destroyed the wetlands for."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Those were wetlands? That explains our Thanksgiving miracle.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Maeby," What do you mean, you didn't make dinner?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," I didn't realize it was Thursday, okay? There's got to be something here."

4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Tobias, This is going to be the greatest Thanksgiving ever.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, It's a miracle!
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Well, I actually do live in a fairly large house right now. But we've never made a payment on it."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, So you're sticking it to big banking. That's cool.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Yes.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," In fact, I'm only in America because a shaman told me that love would come to me when I accepted who I am and didn't run away."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, Sounds like a good shaman.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Oh, he was the house shaman at the Four Seasons Mumbai, so you figure he's got to be pretty good. Oh, and he turned into an ostrich at the end, so… They're not going to have that at the Embassy Suites."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, That's funny. I actually run an ostrich farm.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, That's not a coincidence.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Marky, I've got to tell you, talking about these social issues, it's the first time I've felt like myself in a really long time."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," That's because I say what I mean, I do what I feel. No lies."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, Lindsay felt guilty because she was about to go enter a crab house / courtroom and do just that.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," That's why my motto is, ""Live truthfully and skate through life."""
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, Marky felt guilty because it wasn't his motto. It was the motto of a surf and skateboard company.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Skater, Live truthfully. Skate through life.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, That's amazing.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," I haven't felt this deep a connection with someone in a long, long time…"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, …other than DeBrie.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, I can't believe we just did that.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, I can't believe how little give your teeth have.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," So, where do you keep your ostriches?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Loretta, Sheraton mini soap for a taco salad?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Counter Man, We don't take hotel soap!
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, And perhaps it was to get back at her mother…
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, Leave a tip! Leave a tip!
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," Or to get out of a relationship that had been over for a long time, but that's when Lindsay hopped off to pursue a life she felt was her destiny."

4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Wow. That was so fast.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," Thanks. I didn't know how long we'd be stuck in traffic, so… Oh! And it sounds like it's moving, so…"

4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, Careful!
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," And as they drove, they learned so much about each other."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," I was always just in such a rush to grow up and change this world, and foolishly, the teeth I pulled were my adult teeth. So this guy all the way to that guy back there, that's just a piece of wood I stick in there. I mean, they're just chewing tools. I don't care about looks."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," But you find me pretty, though, right?"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," No. I have no idea what you look like. I have this condition called face blindness. I mean, I can tell you're a woman."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Oh, stop."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," But, honestly, no, all I see is, eyes and nose, hair, ears and…"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," But I can tell you got a great heart, Lindsay. I can tell you've been living a lie."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, You and I are going to change this world together. Whoo!
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," You know, my shaman told me that I should stop caring about appearances. My whole life, that's all anyone has ever praised. All my mom ever cared about. Because I'm really pretty. I just thought I'd tell you that so the story made sense."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, I don't care.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, But I guess it's kind of karma that I ended up with someone who wanted to make love to me no matter what I look like.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," Also wanted to make sure you weren't a dude. I can tell with voices usually, but some guys, they'll fool you if that's what they want to do."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, Hey… Are you smiling at me?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator, Lindsay decided it was only fair to let her husband know their new start had reached a new end.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," I left. I guess you noticed. Look, I'm sorry. I really do care about you, Tobias, but we were trying to save something that just couldn't be saved. And I have to follow my shaman's advice. I have to be true to myself for once. And Marky, he sees me for who I really am. He respects me and…"
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," Come on, lady! You want to wrap this up? My lady needs to call her loser ex."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay," Marky, it's me. it's Lindsay."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, Oh! I thought you were taking a dump. I must have scared the (BLEEP) off that lady in the bathroom when I threw the door open and told her I loved her.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, He loves me?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, (to bathroom) Sorry. False alarm. I don't love you.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, I got to go. Can you delete this so I can leave a message for Maeby?
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, It's good. She's fine.

4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark, And now we've freed the night up to dance again. Come on.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Okay.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Narrator," And the next day, Lindsay awoke to discover the destiny foretold to her in India in drab colors before her."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Joan Bark, Get away from her. Don't mess with her! She's none of your business.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Lindsay, Thank you.
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Joan Bark," I said get away from her, you slut! You're scaring the bird."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," No, no, Mom. Mom, she's with us. She lives with us now."
4,Indian Takers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Indian_Takers,Marky Bark," And, Mom, she tells me she's pretty."

4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Sort of.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, Michael had tried to leave real estate behind and get a job in the high-tech sector.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," However, I will tell you that in my last position, I had a company car provision."

4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, I'm used to a car with some stares.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, Albeit one that had trouble negotiating low-hanging obstacles. Which is why he parted with it.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," I'm actually working in high tech, but it does collide with real estate. This is going to be low. I hooked it."

4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Barry," So I got a really interesting call from Ron Howard, of all people. He's directing now, apparently, and wants to meet you at his office in, get this, Beverly Hills."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Why does Ron… Why does Ron Howard want to meet with me?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Barry," I don't know. His office didn't say. And if you don't mind, I'm a little busy with a case of my own."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Did you get any other information?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Barry," Apparently, he directed a movie called Cocoon."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Sorry. I was unclear about why he wants to meet with me.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Barry, I don't know. You want me to tell him to go (BLEEP) himself? I can tell Ron Howard to go (BLEEP) himself. Tell him to shove it up his (BLEEP) I just can't do it now because I'm in front of a jury.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Barry, I will meet with him. You're in front of a jury right now?"

4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Bob Loblaw," Why is that, Mr. Zuckerkorn?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Barry, I'm not tall enough.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Bob Loblaw, You're not tall enough.

4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, That's not very nice.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty," ""Ankles"" means ""leaves"" in Variety, Michael."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Kitty Sanchez. What are you doing here?

4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," And she'd proven as loyal to him as she was to her former boss, Michael's father. But without the quote-unquote benefits. Also, Imagine provided no health benefits."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Great for you. How'd you get this job?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty," Women can be movie executives, you pig. I knew people."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," You're probably going to call me a pig for this, too, but are you sure that you meant to say ""knew""?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," She did. The only thing at Imagine that Kitty blew was smoke up the skirt of the young woman who hired her, Michael's niece, Maeby, who was then working as a film executive."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Maeby, My first project is about my family.

4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty, And I even helped bury some of them.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, Maeby was only 17 at the time.

4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Do you have any idea why Ron Howard wants to see me?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty," Believe me, if I could think like Ron Howard, I'd own the second largest building in Beverly Hills."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, Only Jerry Bruckheimer's building was technically taller. But who wants to be south of Wilshire?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Receptionist, Mr. Howard will see you now.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Oh, great."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Receptionist, I'll take you to the private elevator.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Thanks.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty," Ooh, going to meet the big man himself."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," But first, Michael would have to pass a few little Rons."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Luisa Velez, Michael Bluth.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Hey.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Hey, nice try, mister."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, We're never going to beat the original.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Luisa Velez," Well, that's what I've been saying."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Hi. Hey.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Oh, Michael. Thanks for coming down."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, How are you? Pleasure to meet you.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, I'm just finishing up casting this Andy Griffith Showthing.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Okay. Yeah. Hang on a second. You guys finally making that movie? I've been reading about it for, like, 40 years."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Well, it's not a done deal yet, but I want to talk about you."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Yeah.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Hey, let's go inside the LEM. You want to?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Is this the one that landed on the moon?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, On a soundstage.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Oh, right, from Apollo 13."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," No, no, 1969. I'll tell you about it inside the LEM. It's soundproof in there. And it's a national secret."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," So, NASA did go to the moon in '71. That one was real. But in '69, they weren't ready, so they faked the whole thing on the soundstage of Gentle Ben."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Boy.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Me and my brother, we hid up in the rafters. We've seen the whole thing. But I want to talk to you about something."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Okay.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," For the last year, I've been going to Phoenix."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Whoa! Whoa! Hang on, now. Are you kidding me? I'm a Phoenix. I've never met anyone else in person that, uh, also goes there. That's amazing. I guess that's the downside of going to college online."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Well, I just got a sick aunt down there."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Oh, I see."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," But on the last flight, I was flipping through the magazine, and I saw something."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," No, no, no. Not the begging photo."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Now, I don't think you know this about me. But most of my movies are based on still photographs that I find truly inspiring."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, It was true. Splash was based on what turned out to be a counterfeit Hockney that Brian talked Ron into buying. The Da Vinci Code was from this photo.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," You know Willow? That was from a Soft'n Snuggly coupon I got in the mail. But a man who is passionate enough to beg, well, that's a character whose story we really want to see."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Really?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Plus I've been dying to figure out a way to do something about the market crash ever since my partner, Brian Grazer, was tipped off that it was three months away from happening."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, What's that?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, But I never had a face to put on it. Until now. You. Your wife is dying. You're trying to hold your family together.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Oh, gosh, no, no, no. My wife died years before any of this."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Oh, gee. I think it's a lot more fun if we see her die."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, That is fun.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," And by the way, then it's a fantastic part for a leading lady. In fact, my girl Rebel would be great in that part."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Your girl?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, Rebel Alley. She's an actress. You know her.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, He didn't.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," I do. Yes, of course I do. Your girl, huh?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Well, we kind of like to keep that quiet."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," Michael assumed that by ""my girl,"" Ron was referring to his mistress…"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," I can see why you're telling me in the LEM, huh?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, …but Ron was actually talking about his daughter.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, You probably think I'm terrible for even mentioning her to you.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," No, no, I'm not one to judge. I'm sure you've all got girls up here in Hollywood."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, Brian's got two boys.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," I think you're a natural and it could be a great movie. You know, and it's a real chance to show you guys off, too."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Us guys?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Well, it's about the whole family."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Them?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, We're gonna need everybody's signature on these releases in order to make this story. Although the real heartbeat of this thing is the father-son dynamic.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Yeah. You know, Ron, I don't know if I can do this. We're not in a great way right now, and it might not be worth…"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Michael, take a few of these cards and really think about it."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, All right.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, I got a tough meeting coming up now. How do you tell Ed Harris that he's simply not a Barney?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," And while Ed was getting some bad news, Michael got some good news."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Excuse me. Is this a mistake? Am I a producer?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Luisa Velez, It's one of the perks of having a movie made about you.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Oh!
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Luisa Velez," Health plan is not another one, by the way. No health plan."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," Michael had been given an opportunity to turn his life around, and all he had to do to make it happen was to get his family's signatures."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," …signatures, especially my father's."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Barry, (on phone) Sounds like your thing went a lot better than my thing.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Except I haven't spoken to them for a long time. I mean, since I… Well, since my mom…"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Barry, Left?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Yeah, for prison, yeah. You want to know what? Frankly, I think Ron Howard just wants to get a movie for his girlfriend."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Barry, It sounds like Ron Howard is casting with his (BLEEP)
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Well, it is hard to believe, but I guess they've all got their mistresses up here in showbiz, you know. It's like it's their God-given…"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Barry, Front?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Police officer," No, right."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," No, right."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Barry," Calm down, everybody, all right? I got it."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, You think my dad would ever even go for something like this?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Barry," You know, it's very hard to get a signature out of him. It's like somebody a long time ago said ""Hey, what if you never signed anything…"""
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Young Barry," Hey, what if you never signed anything? Because you said you didn't have a signature? Just like you, Pop."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"Young George, Sr.", You don't have a signature?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Young Barry," No, he's never given me one card. Not one birthday card, which is why his presents are always money orders. Right, Pop?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Herb Zuckerkorn, I don't have a signature.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Young Barry," Oh! If you don't sign, you will be fine. Hey."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Young Lucille, He's very smart.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"Young George, Sr.", He's very good.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Herb Zuckerkorn, Can you feel your hands? I can't feel my pinky or this one.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, I hear what you're saying. My dad would never do something like this for me. I'm gonna head back in. I'm gonna tell Ron Howard to forget about it.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Barry," Yeah, you're screwed."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Yeah.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Barry, Do me a favor.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Okay.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Barry, Tell Ron Howard to go shove his (BLEEP)
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Bye bye, Barry."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Sorry. Whoops. Whoa, sorry. That was my fault."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, No.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, I was looking at my phone.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, It's not too embarrassing walking around with a bunch of photographs of yourself.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Well, looks like it's part of your job. You're an actress?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley," No, I'm a narcissist. Yeah, actually, ""actress"" is an overstatement because… Thank you. I was just sucking at this audition I went on. It was one of these ridiculous meet-cute clichés, where a guy and a girl just, you know, they bump into each other, and they…"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, They fall in love.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley," God, you're handsome."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, I got maybe a lucky hair day. You're the beautiful one.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, You have beautiful eyes.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, My deceased wife had red hair.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley," Yep, garbage like that. And it's so unbelievable. Like, they never get each other's names."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Pretty stupid. Oops! Gosh.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley," Oh, ow!"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Are you okay?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, That really hurt.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, You okay?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley," I wish I had done that well in the audition. Where's a movie producer when you need one, right? Well, it was really nice to meet you."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Yes, you, too."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, I'm a movie producer.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Sorry. I'm a movie… Here, I've got… I've got proof here. Huh?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley," Oh, you are a movie producer."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Yeah. Yeah, there's a part for a wife, and you'd be perfect for the movie."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, Do you like Scottish music?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, With the screeching horns and the silly…
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, Yeah. I'm in a band.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, I love it. it's great.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley," We're playing at the Ealing Club tomorrow night, and maybe you could come and just check it out."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Oh, yeah? I don't even know what that is."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, (laughs)
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," I should've… Sorry. That's funny. I should have said, ""Where?"" Of course, I know what it is."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley," No, it's on the top of that building."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Okay.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, But can you imagine driving that car?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," No, I can't. No."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, It wasn't until Michael had walked two blocks past the California Pizza Kitchen when this happened.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," (sings) Hey, I met a girl today / and her name is (BLEEP)"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," So Michael went back to find her or, at the very least, try looking for a head shot with her name on it."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Nothing? She was super-pretty, red hair…"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," But even without her name, he knew his only chance with her was to be a real producer, and that meant getting a signature from a father whose face he hadn't seen in ages."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Lucille 2, You're making me dizzy!
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, And that's when he suddenly did.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Lucille 2, We have to keep this quiet!
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Dad?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr."," No, no."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Hi.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Lucille 2, Don't say I'm down here.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Right here.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr.", Hey.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, What's going on?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr.", I just came back to get…
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Lucille 2, Don't acknowledge me.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr."," …get some suits, you know, so I can look like the uptight, dishonest, cheating boob that I am."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Well, I never said ""boob."" Although you are in the wrong Lucille's apartment, so unless you're looking for a Bob Mackie original, could be some truth to the cheating part."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr."," Yeah, well, I was in the desert, and I've lost my sense of direction."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Hey. Where you going? Dad.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Hey, hey, hey. Listen. You're getting divorced. I am not one to judge. Great to see you again. The past is the past, and things have worked out, and I've met a wonderful woman named… Well, don't worry about that, but I'm a movie producer now. Unbelievable. They're making a movie out of my life. The girl I met is perfect to play my wife. And it's. I don't know. Can you believe it?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," And I know what you're thinking. ""Can you put me in it?"""
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr.", I don't care.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Do I have what I hope I've got? Anybody who's getting in the movie needs to sign this. It's a simple signature. I think that everybody needs to see who the real George Sr. is, don't you?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr.", I think it would all depend on how George Sr. was portrayed.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Well, he is not the most positive character, but you sign this, and I don't see any reason why we can't make him seem very, very, uh, you know…"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Uh…
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Uh…
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Uh…
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Nice.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr.", Go to hell.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Huh?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, Michael was actually relieved.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, You go to hell.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, He had no idea how he was going to make his father seem nice.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," Michael Bluth was starting his new life as a producer in, get this, Beverly Hills without the signature he needed to make it happen."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty, Your office is only one floor below Ron Howard's.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Yeah? Must be a pretty important project to him, then, huh?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty, That's one possibility. Watch your head.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Are these ceilings a little lower?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty," Brian and Ron wanted the ceiling in their office to be a few inches taller, but, apparently, Bruckheimer knows someone on city council and they wouldn't let them make the building taller. So Ron said, ""(BLEEP) you, Jerry,"" and he went lower with his floor. Everybody wins, huh?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty, Here we are.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Oh! That's me, huh? Ceilings are even lower in here."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty," Yeah, your office is right below Brian's. He wanted his ceiling just a few inches taller than Ron's."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Okay.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty, Some internal competition. Kind of like between us.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Yeah. Wait, what?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty," Well, you have a family to track down."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Yeah, I do. Hey, speaking of that. Kitty, is there a directory of actresses, with pictures in it, that I could…"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty, Starting with the casting couch already.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," No, no, no. Nothing like that. I met this unbelievable woman that would be perfect for the part of my wife. And even if she isn't. I'd love to track her down, so an actual couch could be useful, please."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty," Okay, you're funny. This is Imagine Entertainment, not the hot tub at Bruckheimer Tower. We make family movies, you (BLEEP) pig."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Okay.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty," So, why don't you not worry about casting your movie, and instead just get the rights to your family, and, of course, if you need any help at all, I would love to help you. We like to pull together around here."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Watch your back.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty," No, you watch your back, mister! If you screw up this project for me, I will bury you farther underground than I did your illiterate little niece!"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty," Hi, guys."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Mover, Ma'am.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," With Michael's movie in jeopardy over the rights, he decided to call in a favor."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," You know, we're making a movie about the family, and I thought, ""I wonder if Carl Weathers would be willing to help me out."""
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Carl Weathers, Let me ask you this right up front.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Okay.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Carl Weathers, Do you think anybody would be upset if one of these Crinch dolls took a walk?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," No, no, help yourself."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," I know what you're thinking. ""What part would I play in this?"""
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Carl Weathers, I figured you'd want me to play me.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Well, I didn't want to waste you on you. In fact, I wasn't even going to talk to you about acting, but if you are game, boy, that would be great. Let's circle back to that. There's a television show, was it, that you made about my family."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, Michael was referring to the George Bluth Sr. episode of a horribly narrated crime reenactment series called Scandalmakers that Carl had directed years earlier.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Did you retain the rights to my father's story?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Carl Weathers," No, man, rights cost money. I never bothered with that stuff. I figure you go ahead, you shoot it. Better to ask for forgiveness than beg for permission."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," As it turned out, Carl had never bothered to get either, which is why he made himself the subject of the final episode of the series."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Carl Weathers," Lee Nails, only pressed on once."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,DeBrie," Carl, we're at a swap meet. Okay."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Tobias, There he is.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Process server, Carl Weathers.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Tobias, Mr. Weathers. Carl Weathers.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Process server, You've been accused of producing a television show based on real-life events for which you've done none of the due diligence in securing the rights thereto.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Carl Weathers, I only have one question. Can I have your rights?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Process server, Of course.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Tobias," Of course, Carl Weathers."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Carl Weathers," Cut! Now we'll move on, do a little voice-over."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Tobias, God.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Tobias, DeBrie!
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Tobias, Her heart stopped. She's (BLEEP) dying.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Tobias," Hey, Dave, you shaved, I like it."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Tobias, Please get the paddles!
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Tobias," Hey, Mike. How was Ojai?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," But, Carl, the whole point of the movie is that it's a true story, so I need the rights. Don't I?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Carl Weathers," Man, you're as green as old lady Crinch. Come on, people don't go to movies to see rights. People go to movies to see actors. Now, who you got as scriptwriter?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, And that's when Michael remembered that he did know one member of the Writers Guild.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Carl Weathers," The eye is falling off this one. You mind if I swap it out, you know, for the restaurant?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Swap it.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," And I thought, ""Who's going to get it right the first time?"" Because I don't want to give a lot of notes. And then it came to me. Who knows my father better than Warden Gentles?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Warren Gentles, Hold on one second.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Warren Gentles," ""The first time."""
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Yeah.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Warren Gentles," My grandson gave me this, but I guarantee you, give me an old Royal and a glass of Scotch, and I'll give you 250 pages where the lightning hits the tree."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, That's not what we do here.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Warren Gentles," I mean, where the drop hits the pond."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, That's it.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Warren Gentles, I apologize. I've had a few meetings today.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Warren Gentles, Then the yellow robot gets mad at the pink robot…
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,John Krasinski, That does…
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Warren Gentles," Correction. The purple robot. Sorry, I'm back to back today."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,John Krasinski," I bet. I'm gonna be honest with you. You're not charring my tree, and… Yeah, Jerry's not gonna come off the boat for this one."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," This is basically a story about a fellow like myself and his father and their friend Carl Weathers. I'm not entirely sure how to organically work him into the story. You know, maybe he's teaching them lessons or something. Anyway, I'm gonna leave that up to your capable hands."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Warren Gentles," Wait, wait, wait a minute. I've turned it off again."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, They are tricky.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Warren Gentles, Might I suggest bringing in someone younger to play the father? A Philip Seymour Hoffman type?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, A Philip Seymour Hoffman type.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," And so, naturally, I thought of you."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Andy Richter," Well, you know, I'm a married man, so I don't really keep a directory of attractive young actresses around."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Okay.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Andy Richter," I mean, are you really planning on using her or is it like Conan with the girl writers?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," It doesn't matter. I'm here to talk to you about a movie that we're gonna make about the family, and I thought that it might be really fun for us to work together again."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Andy Richter, Help me remember. What did we do together?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, You came over for a chicken and ham-water dinner that my family threw to raise some funds for itself.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Andy Richter," And they're finally getting around to making a movie of that, huh?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, There's more to it than that. It's about a young man trying to get out from under his domineering father while dealing with the slow death of his wife.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Andy Richter, That just saved me 12 bucks. I'm not going to see it.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," I'm not asking you to see it, I'd like for you to be in it."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Andy Richter," No offense, I have a job. I mean, I have a good thing."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Andy Richter," Hey, Mr. O'Brien."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Conan O’Brien," Hey, how's it going?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Andy Richter, Real good.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Conan O’Brien," Andy, quick note. Just 'cause I look at you when we're doing the show and ask you a question, doesn't mean you have to respond. Sometimes it's funny when you don't say anything, and the audience gets to think, ""Hey, Andy really is stupid."" Gets a big laugh."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Conan O’Brien," Hey, you're new."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Andy’s stylist, I've been here a year.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Conan O’Brien," And you're funny, too. Let's get you set up in a writer's office. You can have Andy's if you don't mind the smell of bologna."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Andy Richter, I'm in.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," Michael had assembled his dream team, and now it was time to wow his boss."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Imagine guard," Excuse me, sir, could you turn that off, please?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, I thought that was playing in here.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Warren Gentles," Sorry, it was a slide show of my granddaughter's daughter's graduation from college."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Sure.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty, Michael.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Warren Gentles, High school.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Hi.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty, Did you get the signatures?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Better. I put together the core team. Acting and writing.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Andy Richter,"00 every day, right?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," We've got that, Andy."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Carl Weathers, I'm looking forward to this.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Andy Richter," Yeah, yeah."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Carl Weathers, This is happening.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Warren Gentles, It is happening.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Andy Richter, It's happening.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty," Dude, you are moving way too fast."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Maybe by Hollywood standards, you know, but, Kitty, I come from the business community, where sometimes you have to show it to him already built. Still think you're going to bury me?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Kitty," Well, Michael, you may not have your father's signature, but you sure have his signature style."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Warren Gentles, Cue the music.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Warren Gentles, I think I just deleted my pitch.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," As it turns out, it wouldn't matter."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Uh-oh!
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Hello, think there's a problem with the elevator."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Luisa Velez, Do you have a scheduled appointment?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," No, we're here to see Ron Howard. This is the untitled Michael B. project. I'm actually a producer here. How are you? I've got the office just below the sunken living room there in Brian's. We're here to pitch Ron the movie."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Luisa Velez," I'm sorry, sir, this is a restricted floor."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Luisa, it's all right. For crying out loud, I'm not the king of England."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," There he is, hey, Ron."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, Did you get that signature?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," You know, I've got something better. Take a look."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, Andy Richter?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Andy Richter," I'm out, God damn it, I'm out."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Not married to Andy, but what I do have is the writer."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Warren Gentles," Stefan Gentles, Warden, East Orange County Department of Corrections and writer of multiple episodes of Rocko's Modern Life."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Well, everybody's got to start somewhere."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Warren Gentles, As long as I don't end up there. I'll have 25 pages on your desk by tomorrow morning.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Gosh, that's putting the cart before the horse."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Yeah. Look who I've got to play Carl Weathers.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, Is that Cuba?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," No, no, that's not Cuba. I did not want to waste Cuba on Carl. This is Carl Weathers."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Oh, sure, Carl. You know, I thought it was Cuba with the perfect Carl Weathers makeup."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Carl Weathers," No, no, no, Cuba doesn't have that kind of range."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," The thing is, I really do insist on controlling the casting myself."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, I get it.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Andy Richter, I'm out.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, I thought maybe if you just saw the whole team together.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Brian Grazer," Team, what team? I should be informed of all meetings."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Brian Grazer," Hey, Cuba, how you doing?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Oh, Brian, you know Carl Weathers, Andy Richter, Stefan Gentles and Michael Bluth."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Brian Grazer, I'm gonna skip this one.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Good to see you, Brian. You know, Ron, I think it might be easier to talk if we just come up just the rest of the way."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Oh, thanks. Yeah, the elevator's been kooky since we lowered the floor, but maybe once you get that signature."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, It might be kind of tricky. They're all down in Orange County. Tough to get down there.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Oh, hey, B."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Brian Grazer, Yeah.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, We must have an office down there somewhere.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Brian Grazer," Yeah, we'll stick you someplace."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, Yeah. We'll stick you someplace.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, Michael was starting work at his new show business office at Orange County Imagine.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Visitor, Charles Dawkins.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, And his office was already receiving a lot of visitors.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Don't get comfortable. Sir, thank you, no."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," But mostly because of the sign 's similarity to that of this institution, which also received some confused visitors."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Pitch man, An embolism? I was just here to pitch a game show.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," So right out this way, sir, thank you."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Visitor, But can I leave a sample?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," It's generous of you, but they're gonna be much better with it down there at imaging."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, And that's when Michael got his most unexpected visitor.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Dad, what are you doing here?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr.", I wanted to speak to you in person.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," I think that you're a little late, okay? Because I went to you for a simple signature, not so I could just make a movie about the family, but so that I can move on with my life, and you told me to go to hell."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr."," Yeah, you know, sometimes, when I'm caught off guard, I say things I don't mean. This is a horrible little office."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," So you're here to apologize, is that right?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr."," Yes, and I brought you a peace offering."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Tetas Gigantes?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr."," You hate it, right?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Well, it's Mexican porn."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr."," You know, you are impossible to buy for. Just give it to me."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," No, no."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr."," No, no, give…"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," No, no, no."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr."," See, this is the (BLEEP) kayak all over again."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Dad, I apologize. I was saying it was a very original gift."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr."," No, no. You'll never use it."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," I will use it, except for maybe Señor Señoritas."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr.", I live in Mexico now and I don't always know how to ask exactly…
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Understandable.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr."," …for what I want. And that's almost over now, which is what I came to talk to you about. Do you know a guy named Herbert Love?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," I know a lot of people, sure, 'cause I'm a big producer now."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Patient’s mother, He ate a mouse.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Let's grab a coffee.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Okay, so I guess things haven't been going that well for me."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr.", And you didn't feel you could tell me that? That's why I haven't heard from you?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, I guess I was afraid that if I admitted Sudden Valley was a failure…
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr.", Told you so.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," You might say, ""I told you so."""
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr."," Well, then, you don't know me at all."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," It's all right, it's my fault. I bit off more than I could chew. I mean, I lied about being a big shot to impress this girl whose name I don't even know. I've got this crazy idea that I'm gonna turn into a star with a film that I can't get made 'cause I can't get my own father's signature on a release. it's like, you know…"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr.", I didn't know it was about lying to a girl. Give me the release.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, You'd do this for me?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,"George, Sr.", Of course I will.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," And so, with his father's rights in hand, Michael the producer headed up to find his lady Cinderella Man at the Ealing Club, an exclusive show business hangout."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Ron Howard.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Oh, thank you."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," No, it's Michael Bluth. Hi."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Oh, I remember."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," I did it. I got my father's signature. You said you wanted to focus on the father-son relationship, and I love it. Who's not gonna be able to relate to a son standing up to his self-centered father?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard," Sure. But the father-son relationship I was interested in was not you and your father, it was you and your son. You're the father."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, But that would make my son the son.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, Bingo.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, Michael had to decide whether being a producer was worth invading the privacy of a son who had kicked him out for that reason.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," I don't think I can do it. I don't think I can go… I can't go to my son. That's. I just… I don't even think that it's worth it just to say that I'm a producer, like…"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, It's your call. Maybe the real estate business will come around soon.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Will it?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Ron Howard, I could never reveal that information to a non-producer.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, And then he heard something that made him change his mind.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, Michael? Mr. Movie Producer.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, That's me.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," And like all bagpipe music, it was hard to tell if it was good music played horribly or horrible music played well."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, But Michael was eager to find out her name when she was introduced at the end of the set.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Band leader, Gary.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Band leader,
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Sheep, Baa
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, But he got to know her anyway.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Fantastic.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley," I'm only doing this in between movies. Which, given how badly I bombed at that audition yesterday, it's going to be a while."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Yeah, you shouldn't worry about that, you're gonna get something. You know, sometimes even students make films."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley," Yeah, that's really funny."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, I could just put your name in for something. I do know Ron Howard.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, (laughs)
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Love that I make you laugh. You seriously would be great for this part. You remind me of the person that it's based on. She actually dies on camera.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley," Well, make her mentally challenged and I'll thank you in my Oscar speech."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," There's a part like that, too, only she comes in later and she's British, so she doesn't seem… No one could ever tell that she's disabled."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley," I haven't been in work mode for a while, to be honest. I've been raising my son."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, You have a son? I have a son.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, You do?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Yeah. We've got a little issue, though, right now."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, Let me guess. He's pushing you away?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Yes.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, My son practically kicked me out of his school the other day.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, That is literally what my son did to me.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley," Then I said to him, ""You have no privacy from me."""
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, That's what I should do.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, Lem's six in August. Yours?
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Seven in July.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," Michael regretted the lie, so he sort of split the difference."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Teen, 17, in July. They grow up so fast, don't they?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley," Well, I guess you got to move on with your life sometime."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Yes. Yes, you do."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, This is not a good idea.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, Of course it's a great idea.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, 'Cause there's a lot of people out there.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, Nobody's watching.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley," Wow, you weren't kidding when you said you had a part for me."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, That was absolutely insane.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, Thanks.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," I've never done anything that crazy before. I want to do a lot more of that. I want to see you again. I want to take you out to a nice dinner. So, then…"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley," Well, this will have to tide you over until then."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Look at those. Boy, without this, I wouldn't know you had a tattoo."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, I know. Anyone that gets that much clothing off me better know my name.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Your name.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rebel Alley, Good night.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, Good night.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, And that's when Michael finally saw her name.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," Oh, my God."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael, I'm dating Ron Howard's girlfriend.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," Actually she's his daughter. But that's kind of worse, don't you think?"
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, On the next Arrested Development
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, Michael starts to really learn the business.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Michael," We can keep going around another 20 minutes, if you want, but I know what I'm talking about. I just went through this last week with a guy. That is a hernia. I'm gonna send you to my guy over at Hoag Hospital. They call him the Bulge Whisperer. He does 20 of these a week."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator," And after failing to get back to Burbank on time, Andy calls in a favor from his identical quintuplet brother Rocky."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Conan O’Brien," All right, my next guest is a famous pilot who safely crashed his plane into the Hudson River."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Conan O’Brien," That's kind of a coincidence, Andy. We've got a pilot who crashes planes, and you're an actor who crashes pilots."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, And Rocky hurts two nice red-haired guys' feelings.
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Rocky Richter-Wang," Yeah, that's really funny. You know what else would be funny? If I ripped that red rug right off your head and turned you into Ron Howard."
4,The B. Team,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_The_B._Team,Narrator, While getting the biggest laugh of Andy's career.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Officer #1, Keep your eyes open.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,John Beard," All right, guys. What we got?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Ryan, It's quiet out there.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Officer #2, Stand by.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,John Beard," Yeah, we, uh, we better be ready. (beckons make-up artist) Yeah. I'm a man. Don't make it look like make-up."

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Officer Threé, Look at the license plate.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,John Beard, Looks like we've got ourselves an anus tart.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, Tobias Fünke was on his way to reconnect with a daughter he'd lost touch with.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Hey, there. It's Big Daddy. I thought I'd try to call you before I surprised you. Things are... really looking up, and uh, hello? Dammit. What Sudden Valley does to these cell phones!"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," Unbeknownst to Tobias, however, the Sudden Valley home he was on his way to visit..."

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,John Beard," All right, guys, let's entrap a local predator. Come on, lowlife. We've got to put this piece of (BLEEP)... Who, what, when, where, why and how? Who, what, where, when, why, how? Who, what, when, where, why and how?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Man, Anus Tart is approaching the portico.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," Yes, Tobias was finally about to get a starring role on a hit TV show."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, (singing) It's just a fallacy... Is there a little girl here all by herself?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,John Beard," (voiceover) And now the story of the awful people who are about to lose everything and the one newsman who had no choice but to entrap them all together. It's John Beard's ""To Entrap a Local Predator - Supercreeps""."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," Five years before Tobias was to appear on John Beard's TV show, his acting career was as washed up..."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, None taken.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, ...as his family...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, You are soaked to the bone.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, ...and those men he was touching for some reason. And his wife challenged him to reexamine the other parts of his life as well.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lindsay," There's nothing keeping us together. It's time to give up our dreams if they're not working. You know, your acting career, this marriage that everyone thinks is a sham because you're gay."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Wh- I'm sorry? Everyone thinks... I'm gay?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lindsay," Well, I mean, it's kind of a running joke in the family. I mean, you, you know that, right? 'Cause of the misleading way you talk sometimes."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, You're saying the way I talk makes me sound gay? When in the last year have I said anything remotely-
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, (singing) It's just a fallacy!
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, -misleading? Is this because I want to be an actor and all the leading men in Hollywood are gay?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lindsay, I don't think that all the leading men in Hollywood are gay.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Oh, honey."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lindsay," Look, we're chasing things that aren't real. And maybe we need to go out there and find out what we're meant to do."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," His wife was giving him the cold shoulder. And after kissing it goodbye, he sat with her family, feeling lost."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Well, you look like I feel."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, And very misunderstood.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,G.O.B., Gay?

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," Tobias knew it was time to find out what he was truly meant to do. So when he came across a book the universe had placed in his path, he was open to its inspirations."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," They're still reading it, but... Well, I guess I can leave them some Love."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," So, he just took Eat and Pray. Eat was easy, although it provided no cosmic answers for him. But it was the part about India that really got to him. And so, like the heroine of ""Eat, Pray..."""
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Wait a minute.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, ...Tobias decided to get as far away from his wife as possible.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias/Narrator, And so Tobias found himself booking passage to India.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Hey...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, And soon he discovered his wife was also preparing to go somewhere...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, I think you have my suitcase.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, ...far away.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lindsay," I'm so sorry, Tobias. Look, I've already packed. Can I just use this one?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Oh, what the heck. I guess having matching luggage isn't so romantic anymore. And these romantic gestures are possibly why people think I'm a homosexual. Well, it's time to correct old misconceptions. And that is why I'm making a new start."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lindsay, A new start. Filled with compassion and love. I like that.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Well, I've already got the license plate, so go cry in your pie!"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," And so Tobias, hoping to straighten out his image, set out on a new start."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, Beginning with a trip to the airport in an outfit he pretty much put together himself.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, I guess this is why you never see them driving convertibles.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, I'll have to check on that one. But it certainly wasn't embraced...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lindsay," Stay in your lane, anus tart!"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Indian Taxi Driver, (BLEEP) anus tart!

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," And his quest hit a bump early on, as he struggled to learn the customs and gestures of the culture he hoped to adopt."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Thank you.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Oh, god damn it! Am I the only one who still dresses to fly?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Well, there you go. India clean. Now, how did I...? No. No."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," Unfortunately, recreating the look of the traditional Indian garb..."

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, ...turned out to be more difficult...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, I look like one of those hot guys from Spartacus.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," ...without the aid of Pradeep, the helpful Indian salesman..."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, I feel like there was less up top.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," ...at Bed, Bath & Beyond..."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Now I can't even see. This is-

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Got it, okay. (chokes)"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Yes. I actually like this better.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Yes? Oh.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Chuck, Canadian?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," No, I'm American."

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Sorry.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," But because it was a long flight, he figured he'd wait a beat on finding his true calling and watch something to take his mind off Lindsay."

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, Who he knew was far away at the time.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Oh, God damn it."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, And after taking the wrong bag at the airport...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Woman on Intercom, All unattended goods will be confiscated.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, Tobias finally arrived...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," And so Tobias Fünke embarked on a... Oh, dear Lord, it's hot! Ah, ah, ah."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," ...in India, yes, where he was very uncomfortable. Not only because the wind whipped up his queen-sized fitted mini-sarong..."

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," ...but because he looked the wrong direction when stepping into the street. And so Tobias experienced India from the inside of a hospital room, where the staff was being trained..."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Literal Doctor, This man here broke his skull in two places.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, ...by the same doctor he'd had in America.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Literal Doctor," Once outside the airport, and once in the elevator when his sheet got caught and he was pulled off his gurney."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, Literally.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Indian medical student #1, Two places indeed.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Indian medical student #2," This is very funny. It's like that new show we just got, Laugh-In."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Indian medical student #1, It's even funnier-
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," My name is... Oh! (falls off bed) Now I've broken my skull in a third place, on this elephant guy statue."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, Tobias had wanted the universe to provide him a sign.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Indian medical student #1, You should be a comedy actor!
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, And finally it had.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, This is the sign I've been- (vomits)
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," Looking for. And after two more weeks in the hospital, it was time for his flight home. And that's when he got another sign. A call from Lindsay."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, Although he wouldn't be able to reach the phone for hours...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lindsay, I'm ready to make this work.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, ...due to his already weakened spine.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, Tobias and Lindsay shared the news of their new start at a family gathering.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lindsay," ...and by process of elimination, is Tobias."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," I got the part. You know, it's funny, for I too find that I am on a journey. Although, as we discovered when our MasterCard bill came back, it was the same one she took. But mine has confirmed that I should redouble my efforts to achieve the unachievable dream of being an actor."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Buster, Mm.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, A journey that has left me eager to connect with my true love. Particularly if she finds her way clear to covering a 2000-rupee City of Hopelessness hospital debt.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lucille, The trick is going to be getting anyone to believe that her husband is straight enough to have a true love that's a woman.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, What are you implying?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Michael," Oh, I don't think there was any implying going on at all. Didn't hear any implying."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lucille, I wasn't implying.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," I'm sorry, Mother. It's just I've got a bit of a stick up my bunghole about what I've now found is a running joke about me. But let's be honest. For 2000 rupees we'd both go down on Matthew McConaughey. Yes, Michael?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," At the time of the family meeting, 2000 rupees was $36."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Michael, I wouldn't.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,"George, Sr."," Of course you wouldn't, Michael. You never accept help from anyone."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," And hoping to do things differently this time, Lindsay immediately started spending money she didn't have."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,James Carr, Are you ready to make a move?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," As you can see, I'm ready for a lot that's new."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,James Carr, (on seeing license plate) Oh! Good heavens.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, While Tobias pursued the life of a professional actor.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," I'll catch up with you later. Listen, I'm an actor, you're an agent. You do the math. I want you to represent me. In other words, you do the math. The money, the negotiating."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,James Carr," You know I'm not that kind of agent, right? I'm a real estate agent. I'm a predator. I sell giant houses to very poor people who can't afford them with predatory loans."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," No, see, that's the money stuff I don't understand. All you need to do is tell people what a terrific actor I am, 'cause I can't do it believably. What do you say?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,James Carr, Sounds like it shouldn't be too much work.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Ah. Huzzah! Okay. Here's the number of my current agent, Mike Matthews. He's at Allstate. Fire him."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, Tobias started seeing positive career signs everywhere...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, For decorating my quarters.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, ...he chose to put them. And at his new agent's suggestion...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Hi. I'm after pending.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, ...he even snuck onto a studio lot to hand out headshots to extras and other show business insiders.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," And my pager number is right there. [indistinct under narration] -available, Taft-Hartley pending."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, Things were looking up for the Fünkes. They even celebrated their first home-cooked Thanksgiving.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lindsay, We have a lot to be thankful for.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Including duck l'orange! Oh! Oh, no!"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Maeby," Oh, my God!"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Lindsay! Lindsay, get the scooper!"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Maeby, Aah!
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Throw oranges at it- hot orange! Hot orange!
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, It's throwing its voice.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lindsay," Oh, it's still alive!"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, And so they went to the Fountain Valley China Garden instead.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Woman," Okay, yeah, we cook the duck for you."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," And if the collapse of the housing market, his lack of auditions..."

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, ...or even the writers' strike couldn't deter Tobias from his dream...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Tobias Fünke.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, ...the suicide of his ruined and despondent agent certainly could.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Priest," I believe he died as a warning, in a way. His message, perhaps, to live within our means and be realistic about our lives."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, And yet it didn't.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Well, then, I shall redouble my efforts so that he died in vain."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Uh... Meaning he will have led a pointless life, is what I mean. Yes, carry on. Thank you."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, And he soon found himself bringing his wife to an acting class in an effort to jump-start his career and marriage.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, This is where I belong.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Woman on stage," We're gonna take some real risks, be truthful - if everyone's good, you'll get your juice."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lindsay, What did you say the name of this acting class was again?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Woman on stage, Just be as truthful as possible.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Method One Clinic.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lindsay," Okay, I'm gonna go get coffee."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Garden Grove Method One Clinic
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, And Tobias found himself captivated by one of the monologues.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," And I made it in that movie, uh, the Fantastic Four, uh, but it wasn't fantastic for me. Uh, I got carried away. And I'm like, ""This (BLEEP) is (BLEEP) up, and I've got to get my (BLEEP) together or I'm gonna be (BLEEP) too."" Anyways, now I'm sober, and I'm trying. It's super hard."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, Thank you. Thank you.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, It was a devastating and personal story.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Okay, notes. Um, first of all, it seemed you were slurring a bit there, and I just think you'd have so much more fun punching those, those words - get it out there! ""This (BLEEP) is (BLEEP) up, sir!"" I'm sorry. I'm not familiar with the piece, so..."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," No, no, that's it."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," But, I am familiar with your work in the Fantastic Four, however."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, You've seen that?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Of course I have.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," I didn't, nobody- what?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," Twenty years earlier, DeBrie Bardeaux had played Sue Storm in the low-budget version of the Fantastic Four produced by Imagine Entertainment when, during Imagine's Christmas party, a drunk lawyer reminded them they'd lose the rights if they didn't make the film in the next six days.

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, They also proved useful six days later at the wrap party.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, I almost never get recognized as the Invisible Girl. I can't believe you saw me.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Well, I thought it was ""fantastic."""
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," Actually, most of the performance that had so captivated Tobias..."

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Crow T. Robot, This is the gayest Starbucks ever!
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Joel Robinson, Did his fishing line break too?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," Well, my acting career is over."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Oh, don't say that. You've got to say, ""Keep the dream alive!"" That's what helps me."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," Well, this is what's helping me."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Oh!
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, It's really good. (drinks)
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Carl Weathers used to give us grape juice. But then he'd add $5 to our credit card. Well, here is to our acting addiction."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, Yep.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, May we never be cured! (drinks)
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," Are you crying? Oh, I'm crying. Oh, it's a nosebleed! (Tobias pinches her nose) Oh, thank you so much."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, Tobias had found a friend.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, You're neat!
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, You're neat.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, You're neat.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, You're neat.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," And, after a not very cute meet-cute, Tobias continued to find DeBrie's behavior delightful, even when the methadone made her think she was a piece of toast."

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, I've done some things I'm not proud of.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Episodics? Been there.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, It wasn't episodic. She had been in a series of soft-core porn movies about women leading straight men into gay sex called StraightBait.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," This is my brother. He's gay. If you want to have sex with me, then you've got to have sex with him first."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,"""Gay"" actor"," And if you don't want to have sex with her, you must be gay."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,"""Straight"" actor", I'll show you how not gay I am.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," She did six of these movies, and after lunch, did three more."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," It's nice to be recognized, though. Marky Bark - sometimes he doesn't know when I'm in the same room. And sometimes it feels like it's not the face-blindness, you know?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," It's the same with me and Lindsay. I know she's trying, but she doesn't believe in my acting career. Maybe she's right. I've yet to make more money as an actor than I ever did as a doctor. And that's with CountryWide behind me."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," You're... Wait, you're a doctor? You can write scripts?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Well, I like to think so."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, You should never give up a dream if you can write scripts. You seem like you'd be a good doctor-actor.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, It was the first positive reinforcement Tobias had had since India.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, You remind me of Billy Crystal- (Tobias kisses her) Mmf.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," It would have broken Tobias's heart if he'd known she was about to say ""Billy Crystal Meth"", a funny drug dealer."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Uh, I'm fine. Got a bit carried away when you compared me to Billy Crystal."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, (laughing) You remind me of Billy Crys-
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," Once again, she was going to say ""Billy Crystal Meth""."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," I'm sorry, but, DeBrie, I've never met anyone who understands me like you do. Or at all."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, Maybe with someone like you I could have a new start.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. Did you see my license plate, A-N-U-S-T-A-R-T?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa - did you see my StraightBait movie? Of the same name?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, We should be together. We should run away.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Wait, what, wait? I- Oh my gosh, well, this is happening so fast. Well, what do I do about Lindsay? I mean, can I just improv my way out of a marriage? Yes, and... let's do this!"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, Blackout.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," Unaware that a similar off-menu swap had just occurred at Swappigan's, Tobias broke the news that he was leaving Lindsay in a phone call."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," You are going to be very happy for me, for I have... met someone. It's not important who it is- it's Sue Storm! I'm so sorry, but DeBrie believes in me, and she stopped my heart, too."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," If you're wondering what ""too"" referred to, it was this."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Let's do this!
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, Blackout.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," scene, as they say."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Her heart's stopped! She-she-she's dying! Please, someone! She had too much butter! She's a very famous actress."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Dr. Tilive," Someone say ""butter"" out here? Oh, my God, that's a butter face. How much butter did the patient have?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, I don't know. A Star Trek chess set's worth?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Dr. Tilive," Damn it, that Swappigan's puts more people in this hospital... Make way, people! We got a 61-year-old male in full cardiac arrest coming through. You have to wait outside, sir."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Be careful of her face! She's an actress! Aaah! An actress! Ohhh...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, It's worth noting that Tobias had heard this hospital in Orange County was a favorite of show business big shots seeking plastic surgery.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, We're both actors!
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," On the day of Lucille's trial, Tobias was in a hospital with a woman he'd both fallen for and had rushed into an ICU."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, See? Make-up makes everyone feel a little better.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," You didn't leave me! Everybody leaves me. I've been left in dumpsters, and... on a curb, and..."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Oh, I wouldn't dream of it."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Dr. Tilive," Excuse me. Could you, uh, leave us alone..."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Yeah, absolutely, yes."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," Oh, no, I'd, I'd like him to, to stay."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Dr. Tilive, Really?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, Yeah.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Dr. Tilive," Okay. I'm afraid that you have tested positive for chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis, pancreatitis, trichomonitis, non-gonococcal urethritis... All the itises, really. And there's also a host of osises. Now, what this means in non-medical terms is that you have landed a real party girl."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Well, will she be okay?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Dr. Tilive," Well, we can treat all of these things, but if she's really going to be okay, she's gonna have to tackle this drug problem."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, You didn't tell me you had a drug problem.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, We met at a methadone clinic.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Are you high? We met at an acting class. The Method One...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Dr. Tilive, Yes. I'm gonna let you guys hash this out.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," I guess I shouldn't have lied about being clean when I took that methadone, but I'll do better this time - or are you gonna leave me now that you know that I'm a... druggie?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," DeBrie, look. Some people struggle with addiction. Other people are... incapable of ever being nude. Everybody has something. And, it's my professional opinion that your drug use is a direct result of your abandoning your dream of acting. You are a gifted actress. When I first saw StraightBait, there were two men making love, but I couldn't take my eyes off of you."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, You watched StraightBait?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Oh, just two, four and nine. You were with a guy who didn't care about you. But stick with me, and I'll make you famous, by cashing in on your most celebrated role."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Come one, come all! Get your photo taken with Sue Storm from the Fantastic Four!"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Woman," Hey, is that Jessica Alba?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," No, this is the original Sue Storm, DeBrie Bardeaux!"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Woman, Who?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," The original Sue Storm, DeBrie Bardeaux- No, no, no! No free pictures, kids! No, no, scram! Get out of here! Go! Go, get out of here."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, I don't think this is working. Maybe I need to get a regular job. I do have a law degree.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," I know, I know, and I'm a doctor. But no, let's not settle. Look, it's the Fantastic Four. No one recognizes one alone. I've got an idea."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," $10 gets you a picture with real Hollywood characters! What do you say, $10? That's certainly cheap. Oh, hello, young man, and his... Uncle? Neighbor?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tourist Dad, Father.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Oh! That's terrific. Well, how would you like to have your picture taken with real Hollywood movie land characters?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tourist Kid, Are you the Smurfs?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tourist Dad," No, no, no. They're the Ambiguously Gay Duo."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Oh. I assure you, there's nothing ambiguous about me. I'm Johnny Storm, the Human Flamer, and this is Sue Storm! My sister and fellow fighter-in-law. Now watch as I get... No, I have special effects! Look, children love fire. Oh."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, This isn't working either.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," You're right. Two people in blue doesn't say Fantastic Four. You know what, though? I think I may have just the thing. Just ""the Thing"". Cut to..."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Now that I'm the iconic rock man the Thing, no one will misunderstand. I'm sure the Blues Brothers here will know who we are."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Feinberg #1," Excuse me, are you Sue Storm and the Thing?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Oh. Who's smart now? Indeed we are.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," In fact, they were orthodox members of the law firm..."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Feinberg #2, We're from the firm...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator/Feinberg #2," ...Feinberg, Feinberg, Feinberg & Feinberg."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Feinberg #2," We represent Stan Lee and Marvel Enterprises. This is a cease and desist, ordering you to stop impersonating any of our trademark characters."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," Oh, let me take a look at that. I have a law degree."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," No, DeBrie, I've got this. Mr. Feinberg? Er... would it change your mind if I offered you a free Sue Storm armband? (offers SS armband)"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," It did not change his mind. And, although the hate crime charges were dismissed, they were told they could not continue to pose as the Fantastic Four."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, Can they really make us leave Hollywood Boulevard?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Well, apparently in this instance, paper beats rock."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, You have rock?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," No, I- I am your rock now."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, Oh. So what are we going to do now that we don't have the rights?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Well, we'll just... go off-brand. We'll just change the names and do a cheap generic knockoff. Kids don't care."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," Tobias took them down to a street near Harbor Boulevard, where his friend Gary Goose told him they didn't police very much."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Ability to Be Invisible Person. Hello, young man, what brings you to at least 500 feet past the entrance of Disneyland?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Undercover cop kid," Dad, can I get my picture taken with the Thing and Invisible Girl? They're the Fantastic Four."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Whoa, whoa, actually, technically, I'm Rock Monster, and this is Ability to Be Invisible Person."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Undercover cop," Hey, you guys want the $10 or not?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, Yeah.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Er...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, Yeah.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Yes, okay. We're the Thing and the Invisible Girl."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Undercover cop kid, You're under arrest.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, What?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Undercover cop, Boom. Turn around. Let's go.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, I didn't-
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Undercover cop, Let's go. Get up there. Come on.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Oh, come on, now."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Undercover cop," No, no, no. We're not gonna kill him, we're just gonna handcuff him."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, You can't shoot us 'cause it's not a felony.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Undercover cop, Keep your eyes on her. I'll be right back.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Undercover cop kid, Okay.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," If it happens again, you know, it will be a third strike. Three strikes law is up for review in the appellate courts, but we really shouldn't be charging."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, I know of a street in Garden Grove where they don't police very much.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, Okay.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, Things were looking down.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," And over the following weeks, their financial situation grew dire enough for this to happen."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, (undressing) We're broke.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," But- you can't sell your Fantastic Four costume. I mean, that would be like a fisherman selling his... fishing costume."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," No, I was gonna have sex with him. For money."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, What? No. Put that back on. You don't have to degrade yourself this way.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Man, Hey. I'm not a thing.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Hey. I am a Thing.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," And so, with no other options, Tobias returned to his in-laws' penthouse, desperate enough to ransack the place - when it appeared someone had beaten him to it."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Michael. No, George Michael."

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Lucille 2!
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Help! Help! Kevin, give me a hand! Get Dr. Bhowmik or Alicia. Either one. This woman's been attacked by an ostrich."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Nurse Janice," Oh, Tobias got a new girlfriend."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, Tobias had acted like an actual superhero and saved Lucille 2.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lucille 2," There's my hero. You know, the doctor said if that bird had gotten through my second layer of make-up, it could've done permanent damage to my skin? And I want to repay you. You're a doctor, and you're out of work."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Well...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lucille 2," How would you like to come work for me, at Austerity?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, The rehab center? That's yours?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Lucille 2," Well, my brother Argyle runs it day-to-day, but we are so understaffed. You'd be such a gift. It would only pay 120 grand a year to start."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," Tobias, whose girlfriend had nearly sold her body for money in front of him, knew that everyone at some time had to face reality."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Ummmm...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, But this wasn't the time.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, ...mmm- No.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie, You turned it down?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Mm-hmm.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," I almost (BLEEP) a guy for a hamburger, and you turned down 120,000 a year?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," To keep our dream alive, yes, I did. I thought you'd be proud of me. After all, a doctor in India told me that I have the gift to make people laugh. Why are you crying?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,DeBrie," You're worse than Marky. He couldn't see me, but you can't hear me."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator," The setback sent an emotionally fragile DeBrie back to her old ways. And before long, she was picked up by a limo for a night of being passed around amongst Hollywood creeps. For three weeks, Tobias waited, hoping DeBrie would return. Perhaps it was the morning he awoke to find two bums using him as a pillow that he realized she wasn't coming back."

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, ...and no one to help him out of his rock suit...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Honey, you read comic books, yes?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, He went to see if his daughter would give him a place to stay.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Anyway, things are really looking up."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, (singing) Is that a gal I see? No! It's just a fallacy...
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Ryan," Now the fun begins, right, Officer Threé?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Officer Threé, I'll say.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,John Beard," ...and why and how? Who, what, where, when, why and how?"
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Is there a little girl here all by herself?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Narrator, And perhaps it was this that would finally get him to admit that he sometimes did speak in a misleading way.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Daddy needs to get his rocks off.

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,John Beard," Well, you're free to go. She's not here."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Local Predator Narrator," But this creep won't take ""go"" for an answer."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias," Oh. Um... Oh, that's all right. I'll stay. I'll wait."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Local Predator Narrator, And this creep makes himself right at home.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,John Beard, Give me just a minute.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Ryan, He's not leaving.

4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,John Beard, He's not leaving.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Ryan, Tell him there's a raccoon in the back yard.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,John Beard," Hey, guess what? There's a raccoon out on the patio."
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, Ha - (BLEEP)! There isn't. Where is that little guy?
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Local Predator Narrator, And this guy turns out to be a real comedian.
4,A New Start,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Start,Tobias, I just broke my skull in a fourth place. The patio! Oh!
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, George Sr. had come to a political fundraiser to get support for a wall project...

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, ...that some considered insensitive.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille, My idea!
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", It was your idea.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, Even though he himself...
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Oh! Tender.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, Was feeling more sensitive by the day.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Curious feeling.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, But he tried to muster the old self-confidence for his face-time with Herbert Love.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," And I, I just think there will be a lot of support flowing in this relationship, and your base-"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Herbert Love, You got a point behind all those teeth of yours?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," If you support the wall, I'll give you a piece of the action."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Herbert Love, Action?

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Oh, no, no."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," Not at all. This, of course, is Herbert Love."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Herbert Love," My name is Herbert Love, and I want you to say ""hi, low"" to my low-high plan. The low is for low taxes - and who doesn't want low taxes for people who make a high income?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, A candidate whose campaign slogan was embraced by everyone from the very wealthy...
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Herbert Love, And who doesn't want a high income?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, ...to their bankers and tax attorneys.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Herbert Love," High-low, high-low, it's off to work I go - for you! My name is Herbert Love, and I most definitely approve this message."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Herbert Love," Do I look like someone who eats at C.W. Swappigan's? See, I stand for three things. One, getting Barack Hussein Obama Wama Karma Mama on a Llama out of office."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", It's a crazy-town name.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Herbert Love," Two, low taxes for high-income earners. That's my low-high plan."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", I know it.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Herbert Love," And three, getting a little something in my slushie fund so that I'm nice and loose and can help make numbers one and two happen. I don't want to be the one to say it, but I happen to be fond of redheads and greenbacks."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, George Senior had neither.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", How would you like both?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Herbert Love," Get it for me tonight and I'll make your wall thing the third point of my three-point plan. All I got right now is, ""You want to reach your hand into my pocket to pay for your birth control? I get to put my hand in your pocket to put it in."" But when I unveiled it in Garden Grove, I had to duck a woman's pump and a mini pizza. Oops."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," Coming up with money, however, would be difficult for George Senior, who hadn't been acting like his old self - something his twin brother Oscar had done much more successfully earlier that day."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar," You know, the wall. "
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille, Have you baked your brain in that pizza oven? 
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar, So he only did buy that land for personal gain. Well... Oscar?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille," Haha, Oscar. "
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, Oscar chose to lie with George's wife.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar, Call me Father B. 
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," And although too explicit for an American audience, the lovemaking was intense and beautiful, but for one small misunderstanding that occurred during the afterglow."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar," N-no. I, I mean, it's good to be out of that sweaty old hot box at the compound."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille, Oh.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar," No, this was amazing."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, And Oscar finally got more information about his brother's plans.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille," Speaking of that, we may need to have a president ready to go if something should happen to Lucille 2 while we're building the wall."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar, So we are building a wall. Right where Oscar thought he would be spending the rest of his life.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille," (laughs) Turn him around three times and put him in Fullerton, he won't know the difference."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar, Fullerton.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille," You know, I think we should send our son down there. Give him some training, show that he has a job, let him sweat a little."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar," Buster? No, no. I won't, I won't hear of it. It could kill him."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille, I meant G.O.B.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar," Oh! Oh, fine. Yeah, send him down. I love that."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," Unaware that he was being cuckolded by his brother, George Senior was struggling to find money to bribe Herbert Love."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Server, Didn't someone die in one of these things?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Oh, no, not in one of ours."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, Though his pitch had lost some of its luster.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," And, you know, I mean, it's better than dying in the snow. I mean, not, not, not that you'll die, but if you had to choose, uh... I mean... brr, you know?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Server," Mm-hmm. Well, I'll think about it. Would you like a mini-quiche?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Oh, I am so sorry, I thought you were a successful Republican strategist. I'm so sorry."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Server," Why, 'cause I'm black?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Oh, no..."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, It was over. But at least he could go home...
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lindsay, Cindy's gonna love these...
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Excuse me, Red, you're not the only one who likes coconut shrimp."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, ...with some coconut shrimp.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lindsay," Well. I should have known you'd be here, supporting this right-wing dangerous crackpot."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Lindsay! I forgot, you dyed your hair. What are you doing here?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lindsay, I'm supporting Love as well. We're both doing that.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Oh, honey, I've wanted to contact you every single day since last May."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lindsay, I haven't seen you since January.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Yeah, the first four months I was in denial. How are you? Are you, are you good? D'you have any money?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lindsay, Not really.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Oh.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lindsay," Oh, except for a $50,000 check your wife sent to my daughter for plastic surgery. What kind of a woman does that?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", I thought... there was no money left?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lindsay," Oh, no. Oh, no."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Well, that's awful. I mean, she's just precious the way she is. Does Maisie even know about this?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lindsay," No, thank God. And her name is Maeby."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," You don't think... Maisie's cuter? You know what I want to do? I want to take this, and I want to deposit it in a trust fund that she can't open until she's 21."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lindsay, I guess I can't use it anyway.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Are you kidding me? You are the most beautiful little girl I know. (tweaks her nose) And if you have any more work, your cartilage is going to collapse. Let me see if I can... (adjusts nose again) There you go."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, And that's when George Senior finally tipped a black man.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Okay. Got the check.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Herbert Love," Ooh! Hey, you got the check."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Third party.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Herbert Love," Oh, man. I am going to put this on my... wall."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, George Senior left the hotel hoping he'd accomplished something.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, And on the news the next day...
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Herbert Love, We have got to build a wall between us and Mexico.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Hahaha! Yes! Yes.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," ...he found out he had. And aside from hating the wrinkles he saw in the rearview mirror around his eyes and brow, George Senior was happy."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", (singing along to radio) All you need is smiles. Lots and lots of smiley smiles. All you need is... What the (BLEEP) is he smiling about?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Hello!

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Surveyor #1, Laying out border coordinates for when they put up the wall.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Surveyor #2, Shh-shh! You're not supposed to tell them what it's for.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Surveyor #1," Well... he mentioned the tape, and he looks American."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Surveyor #2," Yeah, but he's in Mexico."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Wait, guys, no, no. Mexico starts back there, by the gully."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Surveyor #1," Whoever told you that's probably chomping on the maca, if you know what I mean."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," So what you're saying to me is that on this side of the tape, I'm in Mexico. But when I come over here and-"

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Surveyor #2, Pasaporte
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, George Senior liked to make men who disappoint him suffer. But things change.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," (sobbing) You really hurt my feelings, guys."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Surveyor #1, No hugging... ma'am.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", I'm sorry.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, George Senior had just discovered that the millions of dollars of American property he owned was worthless.

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, And in Mexico.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Barry," You can't expect me to read every page of that deal. Besides, that one was particularly difficult because it was all in Spanish. It says very clearly on my business card, ""Se habla espanol."" I do not speak Spanish. And it was your brother Oscar who told me it was on the border."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", How did he not know?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," Unfortunately, Oscar missed the signs."

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", And make him a flip-flopper? I can't do that.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," Actually, he'd tried, but couldn't afford it."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Herbert Love," It's a 40 for the flip and a 40 for the flip, and since it's going to cause a flap, I'd say another 40. So it's a flat 40-40-40 flip-flop and a flap fee."

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," In fact, it was Oscar who spoke to Lucille about hiring G.O.B."

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, But not before an ominous warning.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar," But, you know, he has magical abilities. He can handle a lot more than we give him credit for."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille, I know. ...What?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B.," I would have been here sooner but I had to go down to San Diego and loop my way back up because they put up that border ribbon, which is totally new and I wasn't expecting it."

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B.," It's fine. Anyway, Father, you've got to get me a job so I can be prepared to be president."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," All right, you got to keep his ""father"" stuff to yourself. I can't have these people think that I raised a limo driver."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B., I'm not a limo driver. I'm a gentleman honey farmer. The only thing I've got back there are my bees.

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B., The boxes fell over on the way here when I had to swerve to avoid an ostrich.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", You got to do something about this. These people paid a lot of money. Do something.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B.," No, they won't listen to me. They've all got CCD."

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar," Hello, brother. Thought I'd find you in a blouse and beekeeper hat."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," What are you doing here? No, no, no, no, no. We cannot be seen next to each other. (shouting) I'm Doctor Norman!"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar," Well, if you don't want to be seen, then you go in the sweat lodge. You owe me."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Is that a fact? Listen, you told me the property was on the border. It is 50 feet south of the border, Oscar!"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar," Well, excuse me, but they hadn't put up the tape yet. So I was going off Buster's map."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Oh, God, it was Buster's map."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," Buster had indeed made the map as a cartography student, because the class where you get to see naked people and draw them was full."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar, And you lied to me. You told me you brought this property to live on. No! You bought this property to put up a wall.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," I told one lie, but I, I was going to share the money with you. Two lies."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar, And why do I think that you charge more than $5 for lemonade?

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar," No. I am sick of tired of being in that hut pretending to be you. Maybe I should go out there and pretend to be you. So goodbye, George - this is the last you'll see of me! ...Just gonna use the can for one second."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,China Garden, There's two Doctor Normans!
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, George Senior headed up north to see his wife before his brother could...
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Need to come and talk to you.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, ...but he soon found out he was too late by a day.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille, I know what you're coming up to do to me.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Right. What?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille," Yesterday, you were amazing. Georgie, I can't stop thinking about it. You haven't been like that in years."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Oh, right. You mean... slow-witted?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille, I hope you're ready for more of the same today. Mrrowl!
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Uh... Uh. Oh.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, George Senior had a few problems. His brother was sleeping with his wife. The property he was going to sell to the government to build the US wall on was in Mexico.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", All right.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, And his sweat lodge colony had just collapsed.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Okay.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, So he had to deal with first things first.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," If my identical twin brother can get it up, then shouldn't I?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman, Have you had any sexual feeling at all lately?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", No!
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman," You know, the Hopi Indians believed that this spot here..."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Okay.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman," ...when manipulated, can create sexual feeling. "
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", That's my penis.   
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman," Well, you don't have to tell me. Nothing?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", No. Just a little curiosity as to why you're checking your second hand.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman," Oh, this isn't my office."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," You know, I don't, I don't get it. I've been popping the pills, and... I mean, I mean nothing."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman, Are you under any pressure?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Oh, no. Nothing out of the ordinary. I mean, there's some violating Federal law stuff that'd put me in prison for the rest of my life, but I've made love with treason charges over me before. Yes, but no, it's something else. It's not just the sex. I feel... (tearful) I feel wrong. Somehow. And I'm becoming weak."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman," (takes off oxygen mask) Sorry, had the old thinking cap on. Let's go to the lists."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, And Doctor Norman proceeded to run through a checklist of alternative medicine questions.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman," Okay, did you drink some water that might have a homeopathic memory of some molecule?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Do you keep track of the molecules you ingest?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman," Well, with homeopathy, it's the molecules you don't ingest. But, I'm the one who can get hard, so, let's focus on you."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, He then went on to explore some supernatural or high-concept premise possibilities.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman, Any earthquakes in a Chinese restaurant while you were trying to prove something to your mother?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", No.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman," Any wishes you may have phrased badly, or while a child was blowing out a candle?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Nope.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman," Have you come across any ancient games, let's say, glowing games, uh, either board-based or carnival-based that you may have played against the wishes of your best friend?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", No.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman," Curses, hexes, spells, shamen, medicine men?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Wait.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Divine Spirit, The strong will become the weak. The weak will become the strong.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", I did hallucinate one ancient foreboding warrior harbinger while I chewed maca root about a year ago. Could that be something?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman," (through oxygen mask) No, it's not the maca. Your body wants the maca. It's not the maca."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," But finally, out of desperation, he turned to Western medicine."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman," Okay, I'll tell you what, let's get some film on you. I'd like you to get on an MRI machine and try to ride it to climax. I'm going to send you over to Orange County Imaging - they do a ton of that."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Do I get magazines?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman, Yeah. I'll write you a scrip for that. They've got a place right around the corner that plays ball.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Thank you.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Dr. Norman, Oh! (BLEEP) Run.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", What? Oh.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," And soon, after getting his prescription filled..."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Ah, hola? I have, a, um... magazines?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Mercado Salesman, Diez minutos.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", ...he was on his way to debase himself in an MRI machine when he ran into a son with whom he'd lost touch.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," Dad, what are you doing here? "
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", I wanted to speak to you in person. 
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," Then you're here to apologize, is that right? "
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Sure.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, Although he covered pretty well.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," And, and of course to see you at Orange County... Imagine."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," I went to you for a simple signature, and you told me to go to hell. "
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," Actually, it was the newly potent Oscar..."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, Dad?  Hi.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," ...who, like one of G.O.B.'s sick bees, was pollinating one barren flower after another, who told Michael to go to hell."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Oscar, Go to hell.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, Which is how George Senior was left with just Señor Señoritas.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," I will use it, except for maybe Señor Señoritas."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, And that's when he got a lead on his wall problem.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", And all these plans to put a wall down there. Do you know a guy named Herbert Love? 
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," I know a lot of people, sure."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," And soon, he surprised Michael by giving him his rights for the movie project."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," ...signature on a, on a release, it's like... "
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Shh, shh, shh. I didn't know it was about lying to a girl. Give me the release. "
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, You'd do this for me? 
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Of course I will.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," And then, didn't surprise him."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", If you'll do something for me.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, I knew it.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Michael, you got to get this Love guy against the wall between the US and Mexico. That's not right."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," You're really opposed to this wall, huh? When did you become pro-immigrant?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," I have changed, Michael. I cry... at the drop of a hat, and I hate the way I look."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, What?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," I actually had one cute hat, and it (sobs) it blew off at the CVS parking lot. And this whole car full of black kids ran over it for no reason. And they saw it! They saw it! Michael... Anyway, I live down there now. And I care for these people who just want to come into this country and ply their wares and let us freely fill the bay with their culture."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," Hey, don't get me started on the Cinco, Dad. I haven't been to one in 20 years. There's, there's gonna be blowback there, it's just gonna happen. You can't swim in that bay for a month after without getting nacho cheese sauce in your hair. It's coming."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Can you help me, then, with Love? At his speech, at Cinco? Can you do that for your dad?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, What he didn't tell Michael was that the family would go broke if they had to build the wall.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, Of course I will.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," Maybe if he had, Michael wouldn't have overplayed his hand as a big-shot producer who knew lots of people. But a deal was soon struck."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," Thanks, Pop."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", All right.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," And Michael, signed contract in hand, went to show off at the Ealing Club, while George Senior, magazine in hand, went to (BLEEP) off in an MRI machine."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, George Senior finally went to visit a wife who was under the impression that he was back for more.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Please, please."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille, The wrong land?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", It's under control. I'm trying to get Love to come out against the wall. We can't afford to build it if we're not selling the land back to the government. It'll ruin us.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille," It'll ruin us if we don't build it. George, you've gone puny again. Where's the man who took ahold of me yesterday and bent me over this couch?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Okay, okay, let's not sully its memory."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille," Look, we make sure Herbert Love comes out against the wall - right after we get enough of it up to trigger the government payment. And speaking of getting enough of it up, what's going on down here? You need a little more Marilyn, like I did yesterday? (singing) Happy birthday, Mr. President..."

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B., Michael. So. Heard you need help moving these memorials to the death of the housing market.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," Actually, that was a memorial to the death of Pete the mailman."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B.," I knew that. I brought one, too. Size of the man's heart. I just got to figure out how to get it out of the car. If I could remember how I got it in."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, That's not from your Christian magic act?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B.," Christian magic act? If I were Muslim, would you say ""Muslim magic act""?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," No. But, it is hard to imagine any Muslim handcuffing himself to giant glittery cross and living to tell about it."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B.," Yeah, well, the Christians aren't so (BLEEP) hot about it either."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, Hmm. Well...
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," Michael could see that his brother was unhappy, and that his life had not worked out the way he had hoped."

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, Rebel was indeed a rebel. But Michael didn't possess that information.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, I can give you some information about your airless office you're gonna be spending most mornings in.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B.," You know, what I could go for is some guac."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," Well, you don't live there any more, G.O.B."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B.," This heat just makes, makes me want guac."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," Now, now, I know I've got these things, uh, very, you know, meticulously maintained. There's-"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," There's... there are some vultures. I think they might still smell Pete. Yeah, if it wasn't for the movie thing, I would do it myself. They practically sell themselves, you just got to bring the people in."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B., I'm ready to move in today.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," No, well, people other than you. Bring those people in."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B., I'm starving.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," Starving? No, you're not gonna find anything here. They've been abandoned for... "

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B., Do you have a bottle opener?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, Great idea. Cheers.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," And after a few more drinks and a little more depreciation, Michael admitted he had a rival for his girlfriend."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, That was surprising.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B.," You don't have to worry about Ron Howard. I mean, he's not competition for you."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael,  Really? 
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B.," No, the guy's like a hundred years old. What's he gonna do, poke you in the eyes?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael,"  Oh, you're confused. Ron Howard directed Apollo 13. You're thinking of Moe Howard, the angry stooge who's been dead for a quarter century."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B.," Well, that's good 'cause the whole time I'm thinking, like, ""Unless she likes a guy who's funny..."""
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael,  Sure.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B., Because that guy is funny. 'Cause the whole time you're like...
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, You know...
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B.," ""Is he gonna poke me in the eyes?"" "
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael,"  G.O.B., I don't think that the, the movie - no, it might not even happen, because I don't think that I can ask my son. What happened between him and me was very disappointing."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B., You don't need to tell me about disappointment and sons. Let's not forget Steve Holt. That's the story of our relationship.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," Right, well, I was talking about a son disappointing a father."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B.," Yeah, that does make it different. Look, Michael, he doesn't respect you, so you have to make him respect you. Show him that you're a big shot, that you don't need to live in your son's dorm."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," No, I just live in my parents' penthouse now."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B.," Well, then, take him to the Ealing Club. It's all showbiz. I used to hang out there all the time. It's just actresses and stuff like that."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, I don't know if I could pick up the phone and call him and ask him...
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B.," You know what, Michael?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, Hmm?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B., I'll call him for you.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," Really, you'd do that for me? "
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B., It's the least I could do. You've given me a new sense of purpose.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, Did you actually have... an old one? 'Cause it always seemed like you were just looking for the easy way out.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,G.O.B.," Yeah, that was it."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Hi, I'm George Bluth, of the Bluth Company..."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," George Bluth, meanwhile, was finding an easy way out of the wall problem."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," ...and, uh, we've built this wall! We have miles and, and miles of wall. Uh, will you confirm that, soldier?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," It's about protecting our border, which is why, uh, we have a member of our armed forces with us today. Say hello. (Buster coughs) It's triple-reinforced, steel-reinforced. And I don't really know how to, how to say that what it does is it protects..."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Buster, It's Mexican proof.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Oh, can't say... Well, gosh darn it, it is Mexican proof. (Buster gags again) Sit up. Uh..."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Buster," Daddy, my tummy's turning."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," All right. Um, uh, it's triple-reinforced."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Buster," Daddy, I gotta get out. I gotta get out."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Uh, we're gonna be... Oh, for God's sakes, get out. (stops)"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Buster, I need to get out. I need to get out. I need to get out! I need to get out.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", We're not gonna... We'll edit this part out and... uh... (starts driving again) Anyhow...
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, But George Senior hadn't built miles of wall. He'd just found a roundabout way to make it seem that way.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," And one week later at Cinco, George arrived, hoping to hear Herbert Love..."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," (to hat seller) No, thanks. I've already crushed one with my car."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," ...sway public opinion against the wall, so the Bluth company wouldn't be on the hook to build it for real."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," Pop, hi, hey. Hi."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Michael.

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," Oh, the...? It's a terrible week. But I'm gonna fix things once and for all right now."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Is this about Love?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," No, it's about money, but I, I'm... I will pay her back, uh, one way or the other."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", Who?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, Lucille 2. I'm gonna get her against the wall.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," No, no, no, no. She cannot know about this wall."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael," Fine, I'll get her up against the top of the stair car. I don't care. It's gonna happen, though."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", I am talking about Herbert Love. Is he going to oppose the building of the wall?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, Oh. Yes. I took care of that. He is going to announce that in his speech tonight.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," That is great news. Listen, I, I have to go. I have to see if I can pass this testosterone test."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Michael, I do too. (laughs)

4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille 2, Did you think I wouldn't find out?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," I was going to cut you in, I was trying to protect you so they wouldn't link you to it, but, it turns out that we can't afford to build it anyway."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille 2, Build what?
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," The wall in Mexico, the, the high wall. What were, what were you talking about?"
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille 2, I was talking about you giving money to Herbert Love in his campaign against me.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Oh, no, no. That was to get Love to support the wall. Oh, I tell you, I've been all over the place on this one."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille 2, I can't be running a company that's building a wall I campaigned against!
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr."," Listen to me, it's taken care of. I just ran into Michael, he's got Love against the wall. It's done, it's gonna be in the speech tonight. It's over."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille 2," It better be, or I'll talk about it in my speech tonight. Now, I've got a stair car to wave from. And I can't be seen with you."
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", 'Cause I'm fat. It's because I am fat. You think I'm a fat person.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Lucille 2, You are such a drama queen.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator, George Senior was worried.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,"George, Sr.", These fat arms. I don't understand this.
4,Double Crossers,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Double_Crossers,Narrator," And so, it was in a state of agitation that George Senior arrived for his doctor's appointment."

4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator," G.O.B. was feeling bolder, which was perhaps why Michael returned home to find this."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," (inside fake boulder) And yea, as if to be arisen the third or fourth day with all the magic of... (Michael kicks the boulder down the steps) Jesus Christ!"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Michael, Sorry! Wasn't on there too good.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Michael, You okay?
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," Yeah, this is part of my... illusion for the wedding."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Michael," Yeah, what's the illusion, that you actually love the bride?"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., Hey. That's good patter. Looking for... I need people to root for the Jesus character.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Michael, I don't remember a biblical passage where Jesus came out of a boulder. Is it in there?
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," Oh, no, no, no, the boulder's my escape plan. They think I'm somewhere else. I'm actually in the boulder. But I didn't come here to talk about my magic act, Michael."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Michael, Okay.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," I came to ask you to be... my best man. Slash assistant. And then we'll walk through the act later, of course. I mean, not now."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Michael," No. We're not going to, 'cause you know, I'm out of the family. Did you not get that when I announced it over at Mom's place?"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., I feel like I was out of the room at that point.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Michael, I am done with this family. I hope you've saved some money 'cause you're gonna need every dime now.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Michael," Well, the gist of it was, ""You know what? I'm done with this family. I hope you saved your money 'cause you're going to need every last dime now."""
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," Maybe you could be a centurion, kind of standing over where they think that I'll be."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Michael, I'm not going to be in the act.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., Might be a great promotion for the Bluth Company.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Michael," No, the Bluth Company's done. I started my own company, Michael B. Company."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., I have a bee company. You stole my idea?
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Michael," Uh-uh, I did not steal your... We sell h- It would take hours. How's that going, by the way?"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," Uh, not so good. I've been keeping the bees in my apartment. I was using my magic smoke on them. And my bees are dropping like flies, and I need them to fly like bees. And so I've got them out at a bee hospital, which is not cheap, which is another reason I need to be a famous magician."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Michael," Yeah, well, listen, you're with my son's ex, so I can't support the wedding."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., What if I don't actually get married?
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Michael," I don't think you'd need a best man, then, right?"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," No, I guess at that point, it'd really be more... assistant."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Michael, Is this an escape act? Are you running again?
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," What do you want from me? Marriage is a lot of pressure, and she's not into it. Meanwhile, I'm working out like crazy, my diet has become insane. And this Jesus character, I mean, he was... shredded. Meanwhile, we have sex one time, and then she's just, you know, over it. Lets herself go. Her stomach's out to here."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Michael," You know, your whole life is an escape act, and this girl seems like she really likes you. Why don't you just try to work it out and just stop running...? (turns back from fridge) Yeah, I know you're in the boulder."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., But how'd I get in the boulder?
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator," And on the day of the wedding, even though G.O.B. didn't take it seriously, he was a little hurt to discover no one else in his family did, either."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Ann, I know it's bad luck for you to see me in my gown before the wedding.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," Well, hopefully I haven't."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Ann, You're angry.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," Why? Because none of my family's shown up and the only person I recognize out there is Tony Wonder, who's only shown up hoping that I'd fail?"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Ann," I don't know what your surprise trick is, but... I know it's going to be great. And as for your family... you have a new family now."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., I don't want these. (spots Tobias) Tobias!
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Tobias, G.O.B.!
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., Thanks for coming.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Tobias," Well, how could I not? I'm playing Roman Centurion Number Two. What, what are you playing?"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., I'm the groom!
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Tobias," I didn't know there was a groom part. You know, Betty at ""And As It Is Such, So Also As Such Is It Unto You"" casting told me this was all biblical."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," Wait, so... you're not here for the wedding?"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Tobias," Well, thank you very much for your vote of confidence. I'll have you know I've worked for the Miracle Network a number of times."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Announcer," It Would Have Been a Wonderful Life. And later, break out the bagels. It's time for Father M's lighthearted comedy, A Jew Came to Dinner."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Tobias," I hate to be the guy who quotes his own reviews, but His Word magazine... called my Jew ""pitiful."""
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator," But soon, the wedding began."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Pastor Veal," And so, it truly is a blessed day. I believe that we are all blessed, uh, to be gathering here at the Church of the Holy Eternal Rapture. Uh, we have almost arrived at that glorious moment where we join together these two very special people, but first, my almost son-in-law has something he'd like to share with all of us, so, um... ladies and gentlemen, uh, please enjoy a magical... uh, trick."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," Thanks for that killer intro. It's true, this is a magical trick. If what Jesus did was a trick."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., I say it wasn't.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., It was an illusion.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Tobias," Ooh, they did not like that one."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," I don't take notes from you, Centurion Number Two. Just turn this thing around. I am not the real Jesus. (frees himself from cross) I am the Amazing Jesus! No? I thought that that would be up your...  alley. Yes! The real Jesus came off the cross and went into his cave... a dead man."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator, And G.O.B.'s escape boulder was wheeled up to the trick.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., But was he crazy enough to do it... handcuffed?
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Tobias, Handcuff the King of the Jews!
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," no trapdoors, no secret compartments, no way to get out. Thank you very much... Pastor Veal, let me remind you that you are in a church in front of your daughter, your congregation, God. You cannot tell a lie. (winks) Right, nothing out of the ordinary?"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Pastor Veal," No, I, I didn't see anything."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," Yes. Jesus went into the cave, and he arose three days later. But I'm not going to lock myself in the cave for three days before this wedding ceremony. No, no. No, no, no. I plan on beating his record by - TWO FULL WEEKS!"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Tobias, Into the cave with you!
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," No, I said don't underline the ""you"" in that."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator," Unfortunately, G.O.B. was not able to open the secret compartment that contained the handcuff key."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," It's not going to work. Okay, uh, this isn't going to work. Let's do... let's do mouse in drink. Let's do mouse in drink. Just get these people some drinks. We'll just get a mouse. No-no-no. No-no-no, no - you know not what you do!"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator," But it very clearly said in the centurions' script to ignore the magician's protests, which meant that, still handcuffed..."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," But if my hands are handcuffed, I'll never..."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator," ...G.O.B. was unable to break his fall and was therefore knocked unconscious. And as the G.O.B. dummy was sealed inside the cave, the real G.O.B.'s fate was sealed as well."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Pastor Veal," Well, I guess... we'll wait two weeks... and see if he's in there. Is that okay with you, Ann?"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Ann, He's not coming back.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator," G.O.B. was stuck inside a fake boulder in the parking lot of a church,"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," (hoarsely) Hey, kids."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator," ...while inside the church,the daily routine proceeded as usual..."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Bingo Announcer, I-18.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator, ...and the anticipation grew to a fevered pitch.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Bingo Announcer, I-18.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Father Marsala," Eleven exciting days, um, although nothing's really happened."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Pastor Veal," Day 11. Once he gets out, it's going to be a beautiful, beautiful wedding."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Ann, He's not coming back.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator," But it was Betty from ""And As It Is Such, So Also As Such Is It Unto You"" that would render G.O.B.'s escape act a disaster."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Truck Driver, You got to get rid of this thing. I got Mrs. Murray's trailer here.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Betty," I guess, if he comes back from the dead, we could just... get a stepladder. Guys? This, too."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator," And a hoarse, weakened G.O.B. was unable to stop them as the boulder was shipped to a storage unit in Tustin. Although a keen eye could see that G.O.B. was alive but not well. And that's why this particular chair was empty at the trial of Lucille Bluth."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Pastor Veal," Well, I can't thank you all enough for returning..."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator," At the end of two weeks, the big day finally arrived... again."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Pastor Veal," So let's count down. Let's have some fun, uh, from five, four..."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Crowd," Three, two, one!"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Tobias," The dead will walk amongst us. No, he shan't, for he-eth not here."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Ann, I knew it.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Tobias," Oh, there's a note."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Tobias," ""If I have not yet returned, I am in the Rapture."" Oh, and then it says, ""Love each other."""
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Mrs. Veal, What does he think we've been doing?
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Wedding Guest," I loaned him $1,000."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator," G.O.B. didn't fare much better than the bride, finally being discovered on an episode of the auction reality show..."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Storage Dave," Moment of truth, people."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Lorna, It's a masker.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Man," Jesus, there's a man in there."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Auctioneer," Hey, stand well back. Let's get the bidding started at a hundred dollars. Anybody?"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Man, No!
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Lorna, He's hissing.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator," After a week in the hospital, G.O.B. was happy to finally see a familiar shape."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Ann, You humiliated me. You made a mockery of my religion and you ruined our wedding.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," Our first fight, and like all fights, you're a little right, I'm a little right."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Ann, I sold your cave on Craigslist.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," So it was all worth it. We have money to start our life together. Now we have our nest, egg. Ann. Now we have our, our nest, Ann."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Ann," I'm leaving you, G.O.B.. I don't love you any more. I feel sorry for you, and you're gonna be alone forever unless you let the Holy Ghost inside you."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," The, the Holy... Sh- sh- sh- (stammering)"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Ann, Shh.

4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Ann, You know what? I hope you read this.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator," And maybe it was the fact that he had nothing in his system but two weeks of candy vines, but it did get through to him."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.,"00. Maybe you could join me, I don't- obviously it's, it's me, your fa- (phone beeps) ...Nah, he got it. Okay."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator, G.O.B. was waiting to meet his son at a bar and feeling a little vulnerable.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," Lost my wife, lost my career. When I was in that storage unit at the bottom of that rock, it was like I hit..."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Steve Holt, Rock bottom?
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," No, no, not that. More like a... trending downward moment that just... I don't know. Maybe I'm being tested like that guy ""Jawb"" from the Bible."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Bartender, Job.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., Yes?

4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," Yes, sir."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Bartender, Job.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., Yeah.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Steve Holt," Look, I- I feel sorry for you, Pops."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," Hey, pal, I'm not that much older than you, guy. (Steve laughs) Nah, I'm just here, I'm looking for my son. I'm trying to get some cash out of him, actually."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Steve Holt," You, you have another son? I have a brother? (laughing) Oh, man."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., Yes... Steve.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Steve Holt, Yeah. What's his name?
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., Dave.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Steve Holt, Oh - Dave Holt!

4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Steve Holt, Yes.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator," Yes, G.O.B. had been speaking to his son for an hour and a half."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," Wait, your mom's name is Eve?"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Steve Holt, Yeah.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," Oh, God, I (BLEEP) a chick named Eve once. Biggest mistake of my life. (both laugh)"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Narrator, And perhaps it was because G.O.B. was inadvertently so warm to his son that Steve offered him a job.
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," You know, I did the illusion myself and now I don't really have all that much money, and I don't even have a job."

4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B., Are you serious?
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Steve Holt," I mean, I, I'm in pest control, but father and son. What a great team."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," It would be a great team. I mean, I don't care. Pest control, I don't know... As long as I'm not being a pest to you, right?"
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,Steve Holt," No, never."
4,Colony Collapse,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Colony_Collapse,G.O.B.," I mean, no, I'm kidding. I just- I mean- Uh... Where is your place of business?"

4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Joan Bark, Marky! Mommy needs mescaline.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...and his mother.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, It's in the fake rock!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Joan Bark, And tell your girlfriend DeBrie to shovel that ostrich crap!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," It's not DeBrie, Ma Bark, it's Lindsay. I just cut off my hair."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Joan Bark," I know who you are. Now start shoveling. God, you're lazier than Lindsay."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," (gasps) Marky, hurry! There's another dead iguana."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, Oh.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, What does this mean?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, It's probably those bastards next door.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, The bastards next door were actually a gathered group of CEOs...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,"George, Sr."," Come on, Daniels! You ran Bear Stearns, for God's sake!"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...who were attending a mid-summer sweat and squeeze.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, They want us off their land. Probably so they can build a border wall. They just want to separate the whites from the browns.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, You really are colorblind.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," Face-blind. Fortunately, I can see color. That's how I can tell the browns are Mexicans. Anyway, I thought I scared those bastards off by scaring their leader."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky as Divine Spirit," The strong will become the weak, the weak will become the strong. "
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," But I think I overdid it first on the maca, because I ended up seeing two of him. But to kill an innocent iguana, this beautiful creature of the desert- Agh! Lizard bastard, it bit me!"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," God, who keeps numbing these desert animals?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," No, no, no, we'll kill it later. Mom, lizard bite! Mom, mom, mom-"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Joan Bark, Put some rubbing mescaline on it.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Lindsay hated her new life...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," You don't care, you don't care about anything."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," ...but even more, she hated herself for hating her new life."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Marky, I just don't know how much of this I can take. I'm surrounded by squalor and death, and I still can't be happy."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," Yeah, well, it's only going to get worse, 'cause they're chasing us off the land. I mean, where are we gonna go?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Joan Bark," Hey, new girl! I just heard about your mother's trial. She was sent away."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," Lindsay had missed her own mother's trial, and for that, she'd never be able to forgive hers-"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Hey, I know of a place that just opened up."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, -herself.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, That's great.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Lindsay wanted to move to her mother's empty penthouse...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, You dropped your shovel.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...but Marky wouldn't think of leaving the old bird behind.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, So it was a party of three that had to sneak into the Balboa Towers. Although Marky was having trouble accepting what appeared to be a lavish lifestyle.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, What do you think?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, Ugh. Smells weird in here. What is that?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," I think it's just... not urine. And, we're not moving in, we're... occupying a space with central air."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," Cindy? You okay? Ha, look, Lindsay, Cindy already marked the master. Okay. This'll be where she goes."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," So, we're staying. And we'll change the world and hold our heads high. And it might be nice to live like normal people for a change."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, Let's put some newspaper on these windows.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," One year later, however, the only thing they'd actually changed was getting the ""not urine"" smell out of the penthouse."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, You're looking at Lindsay. Still Lindsay.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," Oh. Hey, Linds. How was beg?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Beg was good. I found some, uh, tres leches cake."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, That's great.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Hey, did you clean up?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," No, no, no, I just cleared out a space to work on the Love bomb."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Oh, okay, I'll, uh, change out of these filthy clothes and into some filthy lingerie. I don't think I washed it."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," No! I meant what we're gonna do to this guy, Herbert Love."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Oh.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Herbert Love was a very conservative candidate for a very conservative seat in the very conservative House of Representatives.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," (on video) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. All right, all right, look, look, look. Am I guilty of anything? Yes. Of having a great sense of humor. But the two women who accused me of this crime do not have a great sense of humor. Look, in fact, I'll tell you the joke and let you be the judge..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Although he was prone to the more than occasional harassment scandal.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," See, I invited one to sit on my lap- (David whispers in his ear) I forgot the joke."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," Oh, he's about to be harassed, all right. I'm gonna spray the bastards with ink and glitter! It'll be in their ears for weeks. Thing is, I can't find the glitter anywhere. Did you take the silver glitter?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Nope. I mean, I'd say check the junk drawer, but I can't differentiate anymore. (sees Marky's diagram)) Oh, God, what is this?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark,"00... Blam! The podium doors burst open, and he and everyone will be..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Blue in the face, yeah."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," That's better than what I had, actually. I was gonna say they'd be covered in... ink and glitter."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Or, we can support Lucille 2, who he's running against. She's right across the hall!"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," No, no! She's part of the problem! Wait, you haven't been going over there, by the way? No one can know we're here."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Of course not. Does it look like I'm lying?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, It did. But not to a man with face-blindness.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," Yeah, no, I guess not."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," Because Lindsay could only spend so many hours with a shrill, feathered creature..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille 2, You look marvelous in that! Look.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," God, I can't believe how much I've missed the feel of anything that isn't hemp."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille 2, And try this on. (holds out red wig) Isn't that funny? I used to wear that with the Captain. And I was...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Tennille?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille 2," And not make eye contact, yes! Oh, what am I gonna do, cut it down for my foster child?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," That is what she wanted to do, until he threatened to call Social Services."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Oh - look what I made you.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille 2, Oh! I love it! It's glittery - like me!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Lindsay was no stranger to making campaign posters...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...having made several in her seventh grade class president campaign against Sally Sitwell.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Sally ultimately proved successful with a more fact-based campaign.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille 2," A couple of tiny notes, hon. There are two S's in ""congress."" And I just call myself Luc-"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Lucille 1. I'm so sorry.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille 2," No, just Lucille. But I love it! Oh, I wish you'd officially work for my campaign. We could make such a difference."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Well, Marky says that's not the way we should make change. Oh, speaking of, do you mind if I go through your couch cushions?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille 2," Oh, honey, I wish you'd take the rest of this tres leches cake. It's from a dear Hispanic supporter, and I'll never get it into the bay in one piece."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Honestly, Lucille 2, you've been like a mother to me."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille 2," Ah, mm-hmm."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Except kind and loving and willing to let me eat. It just blows me away.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Lindsay knew she had to keep her secret life of luxury hidden...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, You're looking at Lindsay. Still Lindsay.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...from a boyfriend that was preparing to squat in a podium for three days with a paint bomb.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, Yeah.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," But, Marky, I mean, won't you go crazy in there?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," Oh, no, that's nothing. I once did a week and a half in an oil drum just to throw a pie at Arnold Schwarzenegger."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I never heard about that.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," Oh, yeah, well, the press tried to spin it as, ""Hippie tries to play pie-tin Frisbee with the governor,"" but, this time, I'm eating beforehand. (licks cake off framed photo)"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Yeah, I, I see that. Hey, can I get you a fork? 'Cause that's my brother whose face you're licking."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," That's a face? Everything I do is wrong. I knew you wouldn't be on board with this, Lindsay. I'm sorry to say this, but you are losing your passion."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, What passion?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, Oh.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," You don't even look at me! I don't even know if I've said this before, it's not important or anything, but I'm really, really pretty."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, I'm the straightest guy you know!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Why does every man feel like they have to say that to me?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," What? Quiet! Cindy's in heat! You know how much she hates it when we argue. Now, listen to me. This protest of mine can really make a difference. It will-"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Yeah, it's gonna land you in jail, Marky."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," Oh, there it is. Oh, yeah, so that's... Oh, yeah."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," I don't, I just- Oh, God."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," (leaving) You know what, you are just as selfish and money-hungry as you ever were. Yes, you are."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," That's not true. Ooh, a Neiman's catalog."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, But it was what she found stuck inside the catalog that got her attention. And that's when she found the motherlode.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," (reading check) ""From Gangie for facelift."" What a load of... Mother!"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," And this time, she did make a court appearance."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille," Cheryl, you've got no backhand! I'm working the whole court, and you keep hitting the balls (BLEEP) high. Oh, great. Looks like we've got another high-end hooker in here."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Oh, thank you, mother."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille," So, let's cut to the chase."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I want to talk to you about a check for plastic surgery.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille, I already wrote you a check for that.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," Lucille had, back when Lindsay thought she was only twelve years old."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Young Lucille, New nose.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Worrying it would hurt her daughter's feelings...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Young Lucille," Put a ""Y"" on there."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...she put a fun spin on it.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Young Lucille," ""Nosey."""
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille, And you should be thanking me for that. You looked like a can opener.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," No, a check for my daughter. She's gorgeous. And I love her just the way she is."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille, When was the last time you saw her?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," She's been living with her father the past year, and it's been... really hard."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille," I'll be out on parole by the time you work up a tear. What makes you think I wrote a check to your daughter, nosy?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, It came to the penthouse.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille," Well, well. Little Miss Lives Off the Land is living in my penthouse."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Okay, so you figured it out, Gene Parmesan."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille," Just goes to show, the apple does not far from the tree fall."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I am like you nothing. You're not even my real mother. I am a political activist.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Oh, you're a lot more like me than you know, sister. Except I can back up my bad choices. I'm doing hard time."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Guard, Your 3pm hot rock massage is open.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille," Thanks for coming, sweetheart."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Mmm.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, But Lindsay wanted to prove that she wasn't like her so-called mother. And that's why she did this.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I'm in. Let's bomb the bastard. ...It's Lindsay.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, Oh. Yes! Yeah!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," Lindsay and her boyfriend Marky arrived in, get this, Beverly Hills, to prepare for their act of glittery social protest. But Lindsay was having second thoughts."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Um, Marky, look, um... I have this check that my mother wrote for my daughter. It can buy us a lot of leaflets against Love. And also a lot of Nature's Miracle. There's a huge sale going on right now at Petco..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," No, never! Rip it up! No money. And don't worry, I've thought of everything."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, He had.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," Except for someone to watch Cindy. Oh, but she's locked in. What's the worst that can happen?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Good luck.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, Ah! What a great day to step out onto an over-irrigated gold course and play a game that wastes vast acres of usable and farmable land.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," And after a few nights in the trailer, Lindsay showed up in Lucille 2's Tennille wig, to be ready to release Marky from the podium at the appointed time, and then stroll out together in disguise."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," I think that's what this part refers to, back when the disguise was going to be a two-part horse costume."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, But soon she ran into a father she hadn't seen in over a year.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, ...supporting this right-wing dangerous crackpot. 
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,"George, Sr."," Lindsay! I forgot, you dyed your hair. D'you have any money? "
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And that's how Lindsay parted with the check for Maeby that Marky had told her to rip up. And it was then she ran into a daughter...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Maeby!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," ...whose $50,000 check she'd just given away..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby, Mom!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...stealing some coconut shrimp.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby, Of course you're here. I should have known you'd be supporting this right-wing dangerous crackpot.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," No, no. I am here undercover with my boyfriend. We are gonna take down Love with a random act of senseless non-violence."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Maeby felt a foreign feeling.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby, Wow. I actually respect that.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Thank you, Maeby."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," Which is why, for the first time in her adult life..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, So... what are you doing here?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...Maeby was totally honest with her mother.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby, I'm getting a lifetime achievement award for my work in the entertainment business.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I tried. Tell your therapist I tried.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," But realizing she was still too early to let Marky out of the podium, Lindsay headed to the bar."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And that's when she met the man she was there to sabotage.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," Is it just me, or are we the only two people who don't fit in with all these Orange County phonies?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And had no idea who he was.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, They are a bunch of phonies. I usually don't even go to these things.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And perhaps it was because he reminded her so much of Tobias when they first started dating that Lindsay flirted back.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," What's your name, princess?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Cindy... Feather...bottom.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, Of the Laguna Beach Featherbottoms?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Are you trying to find out where I live?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, And your favorite kind of jewelry.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," Lindsay hadn't heard the word ""jewelry"" in a long time, but tried to stay strong."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, How do I know you're not one of these phonies?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, The only phony I'm interested in is your phony number.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," And like Cinderella at the ball, Lindsay really felt like a princess for a change."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Okay. It's uh, 713..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," But also like Cinderella, she lost track of the time."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And had forgotten to release Marky from the podium.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, My release didn't work.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And that's when she was struck by an eerie sense of deja vu.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,David," (to Love) Right this way, sir. Right this way."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, Lindsay?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Oh God, he blue himself."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," Lindsay's attempt to create a disaster for Herbert Love was a complete disaster, and as she tried to slip away without drawing attention to herself, she was once again approached by the man whose name she never got."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, Cindy Featherbottom. Here's my private number. Give me a call. Perhaps we can engage in some sexual congress.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," But that's a total giveaway, right?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, What a wonderful sense of humor. I'd like that very much.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,David," Sir, the press awaits."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," Now, I don't know what..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby," I thought you were supposed to be sticking it to the man, not the other way around."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Maeby! ...You think he likes me that way?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby," No, Mom, that's Herbert Love, the man you're here to protest."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," And I hear the guy with the bomb snuck up here from Mexico. That's why I say, we have got to build a wall between us and Mexico."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Oh, no."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby, How could you not recognize him?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," In fairness to Lindsay, it was Marky's face-blindness that led him to mistake this photo for the candidate. Why Lindsay failed to recognize musical icon Nat King Cole cannot be explained."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," But he's so modern-looking. I mean, obviously I didn't know it was the man whose politics I'm here to protest. I guess I was just having fun pretending I had my old life back. Well, we'll just be friends, and I'm gonna keep it light and fun with him and not talk politics at all."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby, I can't believe you're such a sellout. Are you really gonna whore yourself out like that?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I am not a whore.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby," Yeah, you're a whore."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," I am not a whore! Look, I am still committed to my ideals and to my Marky."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, Lindsay!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby," Well, you certainly have a type."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," Lindsay? Have you seen a woman named Lindsay? If you see a woman named Lindsay, tell her to bail me out."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," (hoarse voice) I'll do my best, sir."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," Thank you, thank you, thank you."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, (hoarse voice) Taxi!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, Tell Lindsay to feed Cindy. She thinks she's...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Taxi!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Lindsay was as blue as one of her men when she returned to the penthouse.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And that's when she decided to get half in the bag.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," But even though she felt bad, she was at least able to turn a man's head."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," Gentlemen, start your engines."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Although perhaps had his head had not turned...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, Buster.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...he would have seen the ostrich warning on the door.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," No, G.O.B."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," After another night in the trailer, Lindsay went to the model home to give a daughter who called her a whore a piece of her mind."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Hi, sweetie."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby, Hey! Hi.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," Of course, she needed a place to stay, so she couldn't just jump right in."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I thought I'd surprise you with a visit.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby," Yeah, well, the bags are certainly a surprise. You're not thinking of moving in, are you?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, What? No.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby," Yeah, because I don't think Dad would be cool with it."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," No, of course not. Is he in?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby, No.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Oh, what happened there?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby," Kids, or people who... like kids. So, where's Marky?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Oh, God, Marky will be in jail for quite a while."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, She actually had just come from visiting him.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," So it, uh, turns out the glitter was shrapnel grade."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Oh.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, They're upping my charges from prank bomb to non-Arab terrorism. This is where you letting me out of the podium would have really helped.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Why didn't you just come out?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," I couldn't do it, someone locked me in."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," In fact, it was G.O.B., thinking he was trapping the magician Tony Wonder into one of his illusions."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,G.O.B.," Hey, Mark, you guys want to see a real failed magician? You might want to get down to the Opies tonight. It's going to be hysterical. "
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," I need you to bail me out, Lindsay. I need you to use that check."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Oh, I, I don't have that check anymore."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, What?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, You told me to rip it up. I thought you said you didn't believe in money.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," I didn't, until I realized what it could keep me from. Jail's a lot like Swappigan's, except there's only one thing to swap. It's scary."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Guard, Anus tart.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Tobias," Yep, that's me."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," Oh, God, that could have been me. Lindsay, listen to me, I'm scared. I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared. I'm really scared."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Guard, No touching!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Actually, it's kind of nice to have a little me time."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby," Oh, of course, that's why you were giving Herbert Love a little you time last night. You were flirting with him to get Marky out of jail."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Well, yeah, that is what I should have been do... What I did, yeah, yeah. That exactly what I should have and did do."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby," And it's not... that bad an idea, actually. You could get him to do anything 'cause he's probably just one of those shallow guys who's only interested in looks."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," I miss that. Missed that. Yeah, you know, maybe it would be a good idea if I got in touch with him. I mean, he did give me his card. Oh, I could never call him."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby, I could call him for you. And I'll tell him... it has to be tonight.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Well, the sooner the better."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Maeby, Got to get Marky out of jail
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, That's why the sooner the better.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, So Maeby arranged for a meeting that evening at Hollywood's exclusive Ealing Club between Herbert Love and Cindy Featherbottom.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," I like this place. No cameras, no phones, everyone's cool."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Well, thank you for being willing to meet."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," Meet, greet. Sure are sweet. What a treat. What did the lamb say?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Baa?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, Bleat!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Oh. Yes, of course. I was just wondering, is anything really bad going to happen to that blue guy from the rally? Do you want to press charges?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, Who can think of Little Boy Blue when I've got this beautiful face in front of me?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Oh, thanks! Haven't heard that in a long time."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, Your cheekbones are even higher than my approval rating.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Your brain can register my cheekbones?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," I'll register 'em to vote. Your lips are like a Murphy bed. They don't take up much space, but they are there when you need 'em."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Okay, you are a poet. You're wonderful. But, um, yeah, I, I do want to talk to you about a couple of issues."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, Can we just have one night where we don't talk about politics?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Yes, yes, just one night. We deserve it."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, Let's get a room.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Yes! No. What? Uh, I... Okay. We can... talk in a room, I guess."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," And later, down in the lobby, as Herbert went off to do some business..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," You hang tight. I'm gonna meet with some of my, uh, ""constititutes""."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...Lindsay ran into her brother Michael.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, High-low.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Michael.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, Hi.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, How are you?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," I'm good, good. I almost didn't recognize you."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, It's my hair.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," That's some of it, but it's also you're with a guy that pretty much represents everything you pretend to hate. Was that Herbert Love?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Great, now I remember when we fell out of touch."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," No, no, no, Lindsay, I'm kidding, kidding, kidding. I'm so sorry. I'm sure that you're having a great influence on him, you know."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Thanks.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, But if you really want to blow him... away... you know the wall issue that everyone is talking about? The wall between Mexico and the U.S.?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Tell him to take it down?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, Or just not to put it up. No wall yet.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Oh, no, there's no... I knew that, yeah."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," If you could get him against the wall, Lindsay..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Well, I had no idea you were this socially conscious."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," He wasn't. I fact, he was just using her Love connection to make good on a deal he'd struck to get his father's movie rights."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,"George, Sr."," Can you help me, then, with Love? "
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, Of course I will. ...If you do something for me.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,"George, Sr.", Mm-hmm.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," I would like to use your membership of the Balboa Club. The girl I've been telling you about, she likes nice things, and if everything goes well tonight, I think I may want to take her out for a nice dinner."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,"George, Sr.", You really like this girl?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, She's Tracey. 
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,"George, Sr.", Fat Tracey or thin Tracey at the end?  
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, I think just on this you owe me the membership.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,"George, Sr."," You know, we're kind of maxed out at the club, but, uh, if you show them my card, I'm sure they won't turn you away at the door."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, You'd do this for me?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,"George, Sr.", I will if you...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Yeah, sure, fine."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, Yeah?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Yeah, I'll talk to him about the wall."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, Good.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," I mean, I want to change politics."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, Great.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, What's in it for me?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, So not completely change them? What do you want?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Well, actually, I want you talk to that warden guy about getting my boyfriend out 'cause I really don't think Herbert's gonna help with that."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," Well, I have a script notes call with him on Tuesday. Yeah, I'll talk to Warden Gentles."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Great, thank you."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, This is good. Of course.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I'm glad we ran into each other.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," If... you do something for me. I'm making this movie, and I need everybody's rights. If you could talk to Tobias..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And that's how Lindsay agreed to give Michael her rights for his movie.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I'll do it. I'll do it.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, Great.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Thanks.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, That's it.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," But it shouldn't have been, because he should have asked for help getting into a club he was about to discover was members only."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," This is a membership place, huh?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Scarlet," It is, members only."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," Yeah, I'm meeting my son up there. Maybe he's already up there. Could you maybe page him up there?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Scarlet, I'm not getting any response.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And when the page proved fruitless...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Scarlet, Would you like to have a seat and wait?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, You're gonna make me look like a big shot in front of my son. Thank you.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...Michael decided to head George Michael off before he could get to the club's lobby with a small lie.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," Hey, buddy, it's Dad. Um, I am having real trouble getting up there. Uh, this traffic is un-believable."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Which led to a slightly bigger lie.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, We got a light aircraft right in the middle of the freeway. You know?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And then some effort to make it foolproof.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," Um, and, uh, the kicker is that there's no news crew. I mean, I guess they can't get in either, 'cause of the traffic. So no one's going to be able to see this."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," But perhaps, had Michael not have lied..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," Um, I really hope you get this. All right, bye."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," he wouldn't have felt suspicious when, moments later, he received a return call from his son..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,George Michael, You know what? I bet we're sitting in the exact same traffic. This is a mess.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...canceling the get-together entirely.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,George Michael," But, you know, we can just do this another time. Oh, God, they're forcing us off. Oh, they're closing the lanes."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," Meanwhile, in Herbert's hotel room, Lindsay was worried she was too quickly abandoning her principles."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Wait... I can't do this unless you promise to be against the wall.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, What the hell! (swaps their positions) It's better for my back anyway.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Thank you.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, That was so... not quick.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," Well, I paid for six hours. I want to get my money's worth."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Imagine what would have happened if you had the room for the whole night.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," Oh, I got it for the whole month."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," You crack me up. God, can you believe this is happening? I mean, we're such opposites and yet we're so in sync. It's like we finish each other's..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, Sandwiches? What's the point of raising funds if I'm eating sandwiches?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Mmm.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, I got something for you.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Oh - really?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And perhaps it was the heart that made her wonder if Herbert was the love the Four Seasons shaman spoke of.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Shaman," You are living a life without love. When love is near your heart, you'll be happy."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, This way you'll always have a little Love near your heart.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Ow! Jesus Christ!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, Oh! I'm sorry.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Why would you do that?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," I thought it was cute, I saw it in a movie, okay?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Okay, great, thank you. Oh, I feel so special."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, You are special.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," Lindsay wasn't special, but he'd gotten the necklaces on special."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, So... when can I see you again?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, The only way we can see each other is if you work for my campaign. You are gonna be my key advisor.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, She would be enacting social change after all.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I would like that very much.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, She's gonna need a key to my room... and I'd advise you to use it when I call you.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," Since Herbert couldn't officially spend money on Lindsay, and Lindsay hadn't told Herbert who she really was..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Uh, why don't you go make the rounds and I'll get us checked in."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...Lindsay had to pay for dinner the way she always had...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Bluth - I made a reservation?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...by secretly putting it on her family's tab.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," Hey, hey, hello, pleased to meet you."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Hostess," Oh, I'm sorry, the Bluths have been seated."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, But she wasn't the only Bluth pretending to be something they weren't that night.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Who's the cheap redhead? (approaches Michael's table) Well, hello!"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," Hello, indeed! Look at you. (whispering as they hug) What are you doing here?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I need the membership. I'm taking my boss out to dinner.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, It's too late. I already made a deal with Dad for it. This is why I had to ask you for the in with Herbert Love.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Exactly, and that's why you are leaving and I'm going to stay, because I'm the one who did the favor. I got Love against the wall. Plus I've got to impress him. He's making me part of his campaign. (stepping away) I'm sorry, there seems to have been a mix-up."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, A merry one. A merry one. (hugs her again)
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Oh!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, (whispering) I already paid you back for the favor when I talked to the warden about getting Marky out of prison.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Oh, God, not now. When?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," I don't know, but listen. I haven't been on a date in a very, very long time, and she's already going out with Ron Howard, so I need to impress her."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," Actually, it was Ron's daughter, but Michael still didn't know that."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," (stepping away) Great to see you, and you look so good!"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," And so do you! (hugs him again) I do hate the campaign, okay, but I'm changing him. I'm his key adviser."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," Although without an office, she was forced to advise him in the back of his limo. And soon she was advising him all over town."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, And he respects me for it. He respects me for who I am.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," So does mine. Listen, we'll share it, okay? Got it? Great."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Oh, my name is Cindy Featherbottom."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," Oh, and, I, I, I used to be a real estate tycoon, now I'm an impressive producer. Got it?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Got it.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, Eat light. (they part) This is my date. This is Rebel Alley.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Oh, and my boss, Herbert Love."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, High-low.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Rebel Alley, High-low. Just like your plan to hurt the poor.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I thought that was about neglecting the poor.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, I guess the special tonight is red snapper.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Rebel Alley, How do you know this... woman?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Huh.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," Uh, she is... Um..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," I just, I mean..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Look at you!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, (whispering) High school.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Brother and sister!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," We can't be brother-sister, she knows about the family. (they part) We don't."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Just met.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," Yeah, so- but let's eat. Good!"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And that's how Lindsay found herself on a very awkward double date with her brother.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Is everybody's food as delicious as my side salad?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," And a couple of glasses of white wine in, Rebel started to espouse her liberal agenda."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, Are you not enjoying your lobster?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Rebel Alley, It's just a little hard to sit two feet away from someone who doesn't believe in paying for a woman's contraception.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Well, to be fair, no, he does pay for the room."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, Is there anything better than the great American scallop?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Rebel Alley, Look how he changes the subject. Aren't you glad your teenager's not here to see this?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, You have a teenager?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, (with mouth full) I'm a movie produ- Movie producer. Producing a movie right now. Rebel's in it for Imagine Entertainment.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, Oh! Is that Ron Howard's company?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Rebel Alley, Yes.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," Uh, yeah."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," I don't want to be the one to say it, but I hate that guy. He's just another Hollywood liberal bigshot."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," Mmm, there are a lot of those Ron Howards out there that do abuse their power, but I will tell you, sir, that I do not do that."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Well, don't you have to have power to abuse the power?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Rebel Alley," Um, I am not going to sit here and defend Ron Howard to someone who's never achieved half of what he's achieved."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael, Are you saying that to him or to me?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love, I forgot how touchy these Hollywood people can be.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," Oh, I'm not. I'm not. Are you saying that I am? Maybe Ron Howard is, but I, I mean, I don't know. But I'm not. And I am also not (cell phone rings) one of those Beverly Hills billionaires who can't go two minutes without putting his phone to his- I got to take this. Hold on one second. Hello?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," Hey, George Michael. Are you stuck in traffic, pal?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,George Michael," No, I just feel terrible that we couldn't get together the other night, and, uh, I miss you, you know, but I'm free all night if you wanted to..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," W- Listen, I, I, I, I'm in the middle of a, of a film meeting..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, But Michael was still stinging over his son not making it to the Ealing Club...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," ...politics involved, and I just... I can't get away this time, you know. Maybe, uh, we could, we could do it another time."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...even though Michael had lied to him about it first.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," I do need to talk to you, you know, just, I'm a super busy guy. So..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Rebel Alley, I can't believe that a woman would support this guy. He's a misogynist.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And Lindsay found herself torn...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Rebel Alley," And I assume by being with him, you just parrot his values."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...between who she was with...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," N- I don't appreciate you saying that, okay? I have my own values, Rebel, and believe it or not, they're closer to yours than you think."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...and who she wanted to be.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, 'Cause I do appreciate you saying that.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Rebel Alley," But what do I know? I'm just some shallow Hollywood... (cell phone rings) Oh, God, I've got to get this. It could be my agent. Hello?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," Now, that is one redhead I do not want to have sexual relations with."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Well...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," So, are we having dessert?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, No.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Michael," No, uh-uh."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," Well, I don't want to be the one to say it, but if we are not going to have dessert, then I think I am going to leave."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Oh, no. But we're going to discuss those new positions tonight. Wasn't that the plan?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," I think the best position for me to be in tonight is with my wife, (loudly) and tomorrow I'm taking my wife and children to see the beautiful American ocean."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Lindsay was trying to figure out who she was when she ran into a man who couldn't tell either.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Marky?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," Lindsay? Oh, Lindsay!"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Marky.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark, I did it. I beat the system. I got out my way.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I thought my brother asked Warden Gentles to get you out.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," No, I mean from the dumpster. You wouldn't believe the scallops they're throwing away here, but I got out of that dumpster my way. I've really missed you."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Yeah, I missed you too. I feel like I really lost my way for a while."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," Me, too. It's almost like maybe we shouldn't skip town after this next one."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Next one? Another paint bomb?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," No, a real one. On Cinco de Cuatro, Love's boat is going to..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Sink-o.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Marky Bark," ...go into the w- Yes, sink-o. See, the Coast Guard's going to be busy that night, so after it's done, we slip away and make our way down to Mexico and reunite with Mom. I just have to find a boat that won't get chorizo caught in the propeller."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," Lindsay was torn. Her head was with Marky, but it was Love who was close to her heart. So the next night at Cinco, she felt she had no choice but to betray one to protect the other."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Herbert! Hi, uh, listen, I'm here undercover because I have some inside information that you really need to know about."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," But as it turned out, Herbert had some undercover information for her, too."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," I've got some undercover information for you, too. I cannot be under the covers with you anymore. It's over between us. My wife found out, and I told her that there was nothing emotional, that you were just a prostitute."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I'm not a prostitute.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," Oh, I know, I know. The point is, we are through. Here's a little severance package for servicing my package."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," Lindsay tried to throw the money in his face, but she didn't have the muscle memory for it."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,David, She's keeping it.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Herbert Love," Oh, good. And don't forget to vote."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, This isn't over. I'm not some taco you can throw into the bay.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Lindsay wanted to get back at Love...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, (still trying to throw money) Why can't I do this?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...but not by blowing him up and heading to Mexico to be with Marky's awful mother. And that's when she ran into her own awful mother.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Mom! What are you doing here?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille, Lindsay. I thought you were a hooker. Again.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, It's a wig. No one recognizes me.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille," Oh, I recognized you. Let me rephrase that more kindly. I hear you're hooking now. With Herbert Love."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," It's called hooking up. And yeah, I got a little sidetracked, but I know who I am now. I'm back to being severely liberal."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille," Well, like I said, the one time you were nice enough to visit me, you are who you are. A blonde, WASP-y Orange County princess who doesn't care about anything but herself, and that's okay!"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Ah, sarcasm."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille," No. I'm a Bluth, and so are you."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, You really know how to twist the knife. But you are right about one thing.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Lindsay was done pretending to be red.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, (pulling off wig) I don't need this anymore.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And she decided the best way to get back at her mother and Herbert Love was by working for their mutual rival.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Lucille 2! I've got great news. I'm finally available to become your campaign manager.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille 2," Oh, that's lovely, dear. But I found someone more qualified than you."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Sally Sitwell," Hello, Lindsay."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Sally.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," It was Sally Sitwell, a woman who'd long been Lindsay's rival."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Sally Sitwell, It's been a while.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Mmm. How is she more qualified than me?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille 2," She has integrity, and look at this hair. Look at this beautiful long hair."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," I made you a banner. Look, I can really help this campaign."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lucille 2," You already have, more than you know. Now, give her a little show and tell."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Sally Sitwell, Mmm.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Show and tell?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Sally Sitwell," Oh, she just means these photos. Of Herbert Love with a mystery redhead he's cheating on his wife with."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Who took these?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Sally Sitwell," The first two were taken by the security camera in the Albertsons' parking lot, and the third was left in the photo booth at the Ealing Club."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," God, that was a photo booth?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Sally Sitwell, Mm-hmm.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, No one can know about this.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Sally Sitwell," Mmm, I'm afraid they're going to. Lucille has copies. She wants to go viral with this. Herbert Love with his hooker? She'll win for sure."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I can't let her do that.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Sally Sitwell," I don't think you can stop her. ...Anyway, it was so great running into you again!"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Lindsay was horrified that the world would view her as Love's prostitute.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,David, Herbert Love? Herbert Love? Herbert Love? Herbert Love?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And then Lindsay ran into someone else who was looking for Love.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,David,  Herbert Love?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, David.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,David, Who are you?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I'm Cindy Featherbottom.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,David," I've been looking for you!

4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,David, Giant! -trol.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And that's when Lindsay found an opportunity...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, I'll do it.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...to put a spin on the looming photos scandal.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,David," Oh my God, thank you, thank you. And I'm so sorry about that ""giant"" crack earlier. Okay, raise the mics, everybody! New speaker!"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," So, like many before her, Lindsay would accuse Herbert Love..."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Can I have everyone's attention?
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...of sexual harassment.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," I am Herbert Love's ""key advisor."""
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, But first she had to turn his supporters against him.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Uh, okay, uh. Listen, I have a few things I'd like to tell you about Herbert Love. Love wants to put up a wall."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," No, no. I mean, not, not just any wall. A wall to keep out the Mexicans."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," Uh, wow. What a great crowd."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And that's when the blowback began.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," But no, you don't understand. He wants to separate- oh! (man rushes the stage and rips off her necklace) Aah! That's my necklace! What, what's happening? What-? What- what's going on?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Reveler," The marauders, lady, a bunch of young Mexicans are taking over Cinco de Cuatro. They don't find it funny anymore."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," But that was my necklace, I mean... God! They don't belong here, we belong here."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," I mean, someone should put up a wall."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And that's when Lindsay found herself saying this.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, We should put up a wall. Put up this wall! Put. Up. This. Wall.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Crowd, Put! Up! This! Wall!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Which was originally her mother's idea.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Crowd, Put! Up! This! Wall!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Although horrible news for her father.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Crowd, Put! Up! This! Wall! Put! Up! This! Wall!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, But that's when Lindsay found out who she really was.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Crowd, Put! Up! This! Wall! 
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay," My name is Lindsay Bluth, and this is who I am."
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Woman, Love you Lindsay!
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, A Bluth...
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,David, She's a game changer.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, ...just like her mother.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, On the next Arrested Development.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, Herbert Love is discovered in a coma.

4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Lindsay, Yes.
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,David," Oh, fantastic. (to nurse) Sweetheart, could you work his thumb? And honey, could we see some pupils over here?"
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator, And she even gets Herbert's endorsement. 
4,Red Hairing,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Red_Hairing,Narrator," And Annyong tries to stick the Bluth family for a tomato juice that costs him $700 and ultimately his freedom. Goodbye, Annyong."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, The Austerity Clinic was a well-known rehab facility that on this particular day was about to get a new therapist.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Hello, everyone. I am Doctor Tobias Fünke, and I will be your therapist. (police clear throats) Yes, I'm getting to that. And I am also a registered sex offender. Now, let's have a wrap-about. I am here because (ripping sound as he straddles chair) Lucille Austero has given me the opportunity to pay my debt to society. I'm doing this pro bono, but that doesn't mean..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," Although, technically, it was society that owed him, as he was the victim of a merry mix-up."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Is there a little girl here all by herself? Daddy needs to get his rocks-
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, We don't have to hear this again. But he was arrested despite his innocence...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Oh!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,John Beard," Hey, guess what? There's a raccoon out on the patio."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Ha - (BLEEP)! Oh, hey, officers, are you here for the raccoon? Oh! No, I'm not a raccoon! I'm..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator/John Beard, ...because instead of asking for a lawyer...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,John Beard, This creep chose to ask about a more pressing matter.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Is this going to be SAG or AFTRA?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," And for the first time, Tobias started to get recognized for his television work."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Oh, no, no, that's not representative of who I am."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Guard, Anus tart.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Yep, that's me."

4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lucille 2," How would you like to come work for me, at Austerity?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Mmm- No.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," ...had, after a particularly vicious beating with a soup ladle, changed his tune."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Mmmmmmmmm...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, But didn't want to look too eager.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Yes!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," I'm also an analyst and a therapist, which makes me..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, Prison had taught Tobias at least one thing.

4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Mark Cherry, Mark is my first name. Cherry's my last name.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Oh, and Simon says you're out. (Mark gets up to leave) No. No, Mark Cherry, I was, I was having fun. I, I have a bit of a wit. Sometimes I have to tell people 'cause they can't figure it out from when I say the things that I... But please, Mr. Cherry, first names only."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Mark Cherry," So, I got involved with drugs, and there were bees and drinking, and, and... I just decided it was time to get away. In fact..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,All," (singing) Go away, Getaway, get away, Getaway..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," All right, all right, all right. We're not doing a musical here."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Mark Cherry, Thank you.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," (singing) ""Hopelessly hopeless!"" Hmm. And speaking of hopeless, I think we all recognize this gentleman. (sings the theme from The Tonight Show)"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Emmett, I'm not Andy (BLEEP) Richter. I'm Emmett.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," Although he was Andy's identical quintuplet brother. Unfortunately, he wouldn't allow us to show his face on camera."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Emmett who?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Emmett, Richter.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Simon says you're out! (Emmett leaves) No, I was being witty. Wh-what's wrong with you?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Emmett, (taking vase of flowers on his way out) I hoard.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Now that's what we call a breakthrough. First sign of a breakthrough.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, And that's when a patient entered who was also looking for a new start.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie," Sorry I'm late, everybody."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, DeBrie!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, And found one.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Tobias!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," I, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again. You're, you look great, very healthy."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie," Yeah. I haven't had anything for six weeks. Mark... C., uh, checked me in."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, After a devastating night of hard partying in Malibu.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Mark Cherry," She reminds me of my grandma, like a real sick version."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, So sweet. So how are you?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Good, gosh, great, yes. Uh, after you left, I booked a guest-y on a hidden camera show. (cop clears throat) Could you give me one second to organically get... And I'm also a registered sex offender. How are you?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Ah... oh!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," So, you two know each other?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Yes, we do. We, we were a... couple of sorts. Uh... Or, are, are a couple? Or, I...?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle, Do you have time for a chat?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Uh... yes.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," And that's when Argyle Austero, the director of the clinic, could no longer hold his tongue."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," If you and DeBrie had a previous relationship, there is no way you can be her therapist."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, But I love her. Surely there must be some way we can be together.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," I'm sorry, I can't allow it. Sobriety is too important. I am only sober because musical theater saved my life."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Is that right?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle, Mmm.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," I, I'm somewhat of an actor myself. I just had something on the air three weeks ago. It was an ""as myself,"" but whatever fills out the reel, yes?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, I ain't no squealer.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Scandalmakers Narrator, Kitty escaped to the country.

4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," I got here as soon as I could! I'm Dr. House, and it's called GVH. The graft is rejecting the host!"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," You know, we could put on a musical. This place is littered with talent. I could direct, we could get Mark Cherry to do the music, and we can cast it with patients."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," It was a desperate attempt to get to be with the woman he loved, but Argyle had a professional responsibility."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, I don't know if I'd want to risk a patient's sobriety with that kind of pressure.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," But like a dog's wagging tail, Argyle's tapping feet betrayed his true feelings."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Well... Well. When it comes to DeBrie, you don't have to worry about her being under pressure because she's a professional actress."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, Which also made its way onto Tobias's reel for some reason.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, She was in the movie the Fantastic Four.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," Oh, my God. I was in The Fantasticks. (gestures to poster)"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Wha- Look at that!

4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, (singing) Ready! I can see the world...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, It was uncanny how much the two men had in common.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle, (singing) ...shine...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, (singing) ...shining...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle, They used to call me Mister Fantastick.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Wait a minute. DeBrie played Sue Storm, you played Mr. Fantastic. I have a suit made of rocks - if I can get it back from the state of California. We shall mount a musical of the Fantastic Four."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle, I don't like it. ...I love it!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Huzzah!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle, (singing) I can hear it...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, (singing) I can hear you sing while- Yes.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, Tobias had found a way to spend time with the woman he loved.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Please, DeBrie, you've got to do this."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, Now he just had to talk her into it.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," I mean, this could be good for you. And it could be a huge hit, and it's really the only way they're gonna keep us together. They won't let me be your therapist, but they'll let me be your director. I want the world to... be able to see this... angel face."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Ah. (laughs)
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Oh. Oh, dear. Well, that's a good luck sign on Broadway. On the East Coast, it's ""break a leg"" on the West Coast it's ""lose a tooth"". Some epoxy..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," And so, excited that he'd found a way to both be with DeBrie and help her recovery, Tobias went to Sudden Valley."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Beard? Beard, I'm only hear to pick up my car keys."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,G.O.B., Tobias?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, G.O.B.?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,G.O.B.," Ah! Good to see you, old friend. What have you been up to?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Oh, uh, things are good, nothing much. I'm a registered sex offender, but things are good."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,G.O.B.," Yes, yes."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," And I'm working at Lucille 2's rehab center - the one she owns, not the one she famously went to 12 times."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,G.O.B., Can we finish this up over breakfast? I'm starving.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Oh, is it finishing? Okay."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, And the two friends caught up.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," But, if I wouldn't have gotten arrested, I wouldn't have ended up working at the rehab, and I wouldn't have reconnected with my love. True, I can't ethically ravage her body, I have to leave that to time, but she's just so much fun to be with."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,G.O.B.," I too am in a relationship, but this person is sort of a celebrity."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Well, turns out my femme fatale is a bit of a celebrity herself."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,G.O.B.," Well, looks like life is going pretty well for both of us. Except that I'm broke."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, And I'm a sex offender.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,G.O.B.," Michael expects me to sell these split-level death traps. And how am I supposed to do that? I mean, there are no schools or libraries or Internet or playgrounds within 20 miles of here."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," You know, it's funny, I've been looking for a place to live, and that fills virtually every parole requirement I have."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,G.O.B., That's great. When can you move in?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Uh, duh. Now."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," And with his living arrangements taken care of, Tobias returned to his court-appointed work-release."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," People! (counting heads) One, two, three, four five..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, And so began an intense workshop to create the Fantastic Four musical...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Ladies and gentlemen. It's workshop, this is not a playground, okay?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, ...written and directed by Tobias.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Now, the script is in process, but the goal is that we all get a little outing on the Cinco de Cuatro, where we'll be performing it on a boat. I hope no one gets seasick. Okay. And Mark Cherry is going to be doing the music for us."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Mark Cherry," And this will make my stay shorter, right? I'll get out of here a week sooner?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," Well, sobriety is the most important thing, but... we'll see how good the music is."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, Tobias inspired the troops.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Right, let's get up! Let's do a tension flounce. Let's do a tension flounce. Loosen it up. Loosen it up. Very good, very good."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," And after some initial trepidation, Argyle set to work with the choreography."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," Back, step. Out, back, step, back, step. Out. Now, try that. Out, back, step, shuffle..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, And even though DeBrie had some trouble with the choreography at first...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," Shuffle step, shuffle step, shuffle, ball change, shuffle, step."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie," Oh, God."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, DeBrie! Are you all right?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Yes. Yeah.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Baby steps, Argyle. She's brittle."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," Tobias, it does not get babier than this."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Maybe I can't do this.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, You can do it.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Rachel," Tobias, I can do it, I used to be a hoofer."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Yeah, well, now you're a huffer, and that's... not that. Rachel can't sing. Okay. Okay, Rachel, thank you so much for offering. (to DeBrie) You can do it."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," While dancing wasn't her strength, Tobias had no doubt she'd wow them with her show-stopping solo."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie," (singing, and shuffling steadily behind Tobias) I don't want to be invisible, I don't want to be invisible, I don't want to be invisible anymore..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Okay, good. Get out there. Haha. Well, all right. Okay."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Oh, I like this, too, I... oh, where's Argyle? She's choreographing. Let's all do it, too. And we'll just follow her lead. When she comes up, we come up as a group! ...So, DeBrie, when you come up, we shall rise with you."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Go with her. Go! Follow her. Follow her. Go. Am I crazy, or is this really good?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie," (singing shakily) I'm gonna stomp all over your face, even though my s- heart won't snap back into place. Fantastic Four. (clutches her head) Uh. Uh, I can't do it..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," It's good, it's great. No, you're great. The problem is with you. (turns to Mark) See, you keep writing this infantile, ridiculous melody over and over and over again. And I... I say that as your director. As your therapist, I'm, I'm happy that you're expressing yourself. But as a director, I don't have to like it. And I don't. But, also, good for you. Therapist now speaking. But also, no."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," And as the music evolved, so did DeBrie's confidence."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie," Tobias, I just do this now. Just... (nods)"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,All," (singing) It's not over. It's not. Doing the job. It's not. Ooh, baby..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie," One, one move."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Let's work with that. Let's use that.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Or no move.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Good. The, the power."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle, And she's disappearing as we dance.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,All," (singing) Ooh, baby."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle, And big finish right to her!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Tobias? It's bleeding again.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, And with the evidence tag off the rock monster suit...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Emmett, Fantastic one!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,All, (singing)  Fantastic one!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, ...the project was coming halfway to life...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle, Fantastic two!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,All, (singing) Fantastic two!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Fantastic three!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,All, (singing) Fantastic three! Fantastic four...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Am I crazy, or is this good?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle, It's really good.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, And then Tobias asked the question that nobody was thinking.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," How much would it cost to do this right? I mean, really right."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle, To do a Broadway-level production of the 8 minutes we have right now.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Ballpark.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle,"$700,000.00 "
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," (whistles) Hey! I can whistle. Ooh, we have to use that in the show. Now, what if, say, I could raise between $50 and $100? How much of the remainder could you generate?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," Well, if my sister could call in some debts, probably all of it."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Oh.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," But that means we'd have to use the Cinco show as a preview, and she would want to know that we have the rights."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Of course, of course."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Wait a minute. We don't have the rights?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Well, not yet - not yet, but I was going to ask you about that. Who produced the one you were in?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Uh... I think it's Imagine Generic. Ron Howard's company.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, Imagine Generic was a division set up to extend the rights to films that studios weren't prepared to make yet.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Mrs. Astronaut Lovel, Maybe it's a way of punishing us for loving each other so much. I just hope the three of us make it back.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Astronaut Lovel, Three of us? (she puts her hand to her belly) Houston? We're having a baby.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, I don't want to get arrested again because we don't have the rights.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Okay, no, don't, all right. No, no! All right. Settle down. Settle down. This has happened to every Broadway show in the history of Broadway shows, and I swear I shall acquire the rights."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," So Tobias went to do so, as Argyle set a dinner date with his sister at the Balboa Club on the same night that Michael's date, Rebel, was finding her father's character under attack."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, ...Imagine Entertainment.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Herbert Love, Oh! Is that Ron Howard's company? I hate that guy.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Rebel Alley," I just want to say that, uh, Ron is not like that at all. He's actually a very nice guy."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," Of course, Michael thought that Ron was Rebel's boyfriend."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Rebel Alley," In fact, he's almost too generous."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," Sounds like the Ron Howard Man of the Year Awards, though, you know?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, And the evening broke up of its own accord.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Herbert Love, ...the beautiful American ocean.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Rebel Alley," My son is sick, so..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," Oh, no."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Rebel Alley, I have to go.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," Oh. Rebel. Rebel, let me come. I'm great with kids."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Rebel Alley," I-it's not about the kid. I, I'm not comfortable here."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Okay. Are you off to see him?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Rebel Alley," Listen, if you've got a problem with me seeing other people, why don't you just come out and say it?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," No, no, no, I can. What do you mean? I can handle that. We'll see each other a la carte, you know? Like the $18 baked potato you ordered that you didn't touch."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Rebel Alley, Yeah. You're not comfortable.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," Yeah, no, well, listen. Rebel, Rebel... Fine. See you later. Say hi to Ron Howard for me."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," And perhaps because neither Michael nor Lindsay could handle rejection, they blamed each other."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," Well. Hope you're happy. My girlfriend left, 'cause she can't stand your right-wing, American scallop-eating boyfriend."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lindsay," Well, he left because your chirpy little actress couldn't keep her mouth shut."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, That's it. Know what? You're out of the movie.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lindsay, Fine.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Good night.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lindsay, Good night.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," And with his evening freed up, Michael reached out to a son he'd earlier blown off."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," I've got to make a phone call. See you later. Good night. (into phone) George Michael, hey. Got out of it. I, just, I made a ton of people angry, but you know what I always say, ""Family..."""
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,George Michael," Well, uh, gosh, you know I really wanted to, uh, do that, but I just had this... work thing come up, and, uh, it's like, it's like you always say, ""Family first, unless there's a work thing, and then... work first."""
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, I have said that too. I've got politics and producing stuff I can... Good luck. Careful on the... All right.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," After being kicked out of his son's dorm and stood up at the Ealing Club, this particular rejection really hurt."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Another time.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, But he tried to put on a brave face when he ran into a woman he was in debt to.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lucille 2, Ooh!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Hi!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lucille 2, It's Michael Bluth.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Who is this?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lucille 2," Oh, this is my baby brother, Argyle. And here's the family joke. I'm a tall drink of water, and he's the chaser. (they both laugh)"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," It should be flipped, right?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," No, because here's another joke. You owe my sister $700,000 and I'm gonna chase you down until you pay up."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," Yeah, I-"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," And if you don't pay up by the fourth, you're gonna be washing up with the rest of the broken piñatas on the fifth."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Woman, Lucille!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lucille 2," Oh, hello."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," Who's... (Argyle steps on his foot) Ow! Ow! God, what is on the bottom of those shoes?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," Taps! And I can tap dance all over your face, if you know what I mean. Even if my heart won't snap back into place."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, I don't know what you meant with the last part there.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," I'll chase you down and find you, Michael. You can't hide in a gorilla suit from me."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, Argyle was wrong on that count. It was Buster who wore the gorilla suit.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," He's a producer, and he says he'll pay up. Any progress on the rights?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, I'm in talks with Imagine.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," Well, kinda."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Louisa, Ron Howard's office.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Yes, this is Tobias Fünke. I'm a registered sex offender, and I'd like to talk to Ron..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," Well, then you're gonna have to work with our new patient, and good luck with her. We call her the B-word from the C-ward. Or is it the C-word from the B-ward? "
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, And that's when Tobias got some more bad news.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lucille," Hello, anus tart. "
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, And she never even saw the license plate.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, Tobias had no way of being around DeBrie without the rights to Fantastic Four. And that's when he ran into an equally worried Michael.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, You okay?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Michael. What a pleasant surprise. Please. Make yourself at home.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," I am. I'm home. This is my... I own all the homes here, actually. And Gob's supposed to be selling these, so... Where is he, do you know?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Oh, out and about. Me doth think he hath a lady. As doth I dooth."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Oh.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, And they're both bit of a celebrities.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," Well, that is odd, because I, I'm also dating a celebrity."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Oh. Perchance a double date is in our future, eh, brother-in-law?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, I don't...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Tell me about her.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," You know, I don't, I don't think that you're the best one to talk to about my relationship difficulties."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Fair enough. It's only what I do for a living, Michael. (emotional) What I'm trained to do."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," Well, let me, let me tell you a little bit about her, um..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Okay.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," So it's a simple choice, really. If I keep seeing her, he'll find out and kill the movie. So, I either keep the girl and lose the movie, or, I keep the movie, lose the girl. But the whole reason that I did the movie was to get the girl. It's..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Michael, I appreciate your bravery. And I know everything seems doomed now, and believe me, I'm in a similar situation myself, but trust me. We are (BLEEP). We're (BLEEP)."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, (BLEEP)
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," I mean, unless some sort of miracle coincidence happens. But no, the best thing to do is just walk away, and we'll lick each other's wounds. I guess I'm just going to have to give up my dream and my love forever."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, I think I should just go tell Ron Howard that it is over.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Yes. R- Ron Howard? Ron Howard's making this movie?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Yeah.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Michael, you can't just walk away from this. You have to go talk to him."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, You just told me the exact opposite.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Reverse psychology. It didn't work. How's this? What I'm going to do for you, Michael, is, I am going to go there with you, for moral support, and I will act as your assistant, and maybe I'll do my famous gay character. I don't think you've seen that character."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, I think I have.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Mmm... I don't think so.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," The next day, Michael sat down for a one-on-one meeting with Ron Howard at Imagine."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," Hey, hey there, Ron. Hi. Thank you for seeing me."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard," Oh, well, that's fine, but, I should warn you, this is what I call a haircut meeting, so, we probably don't have much time."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Okay.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Barber, It would be so much better if we could just lose the baseball cap.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard," We go through this every time. This is a hat-on haircut, so you just cut what they can see. You got it, Floyd? I call all my barbers Floyd."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, I'm gonna make this quick.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Are you not going to introduce me?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Thought you were gonna wait in the lobby.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Tobias Fünke. I am a producer, as well."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Hey.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," But I'm also an actor. That's probably what confused you. Um, I've done several inmate roles, as well as a couple of And As It Is Such, So Also As Such Is It Unto Yous. But, I'll get to you after."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard," Well, that's, uh, terrific. Do you notice that he's already on my neck hair?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Yes. Last time I was in here we talked about I wouldn't come back until I had all the release signatures. I wanted to give you an update on that.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard, Terrific. You can just leave 'em on Louisa's desk.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," But, but that's, uh, that's the update. I don't have them."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Barber, Done.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard," Okay, well, thanks for coming."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," Well, um..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Don't you have something else you wanted to say?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Yeah.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," If not, I'll do mine."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," No, no, no. What? I don't... Ron, I care about someone deeply, and I think that you may also care about this person."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard," Hey, that's terrific."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, It's Rebel. Rebel Alley. And she thinks that you're always going to be in her life.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard, I'm... glad to know she thinks that.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Yeah.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Tell him how you feel about her.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," Yeah, I, you know, I'm crazy about her, and, I, I just, I'm not going to be able to do anything about that until you let her go."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard, She's my little num-num.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Sure.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard, You understand what I'm saying.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Of course.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard," I, I've changed her, I've bathed her."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, (whispers) Now you want to bathe her.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," Yeah, yeah, it's my, it's my time to bathe her."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, (whispers) She should be your num-num.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," She should be my num-num, and you've got to just let her go, I think, once and for all."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard," You know, a father doesn't really like to hear that when it comes to his daughter."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, I haven't had a chance to talk to her father.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," Yeah, I have not yet had a chance to talk to her father, but..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," No, no. I was saying that. Because you are talking to her father."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard, Did you not know that I'm... Rebel's dad?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," I knew that part. But I, I also... I, I thought that, that, that you might also be her..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Her lover?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, No.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Well, this is hardly an episode of Happy Days. I get it. I was arrested as a sex offender, but at least I knew it was my daughter I was arrested for coming on to."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Now, about my project, it's a family piece."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Does this mean our project is dead?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard," Listen, I never let personal matters interfere with business. However, you should know she's dating someone else, and, I'll do everything in my power to make sure she never dates you again."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Incredibly fair of you.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Well, that was a merry mix-up, eh? Now, about my project. It's based on something that you produced in '92. The Fantastic Four."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard," Well, that was a favor that I did for Fox."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," The Musical. Which, with a wave of your little pink hand, you could make happen, and then I'd owe you one."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard," Well, uh... thanks, but, uh, I couldn't do that."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," It, it would just be so incredibly meaningful and, and, and change so many lives."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard, I can't do it. But... I also don't want to. (they both chuckle)
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Mmm. (goes for the throat) You are ruining my life, Ron Howard! You're ruining-"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael," Oh, no-no-no-no-"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Ron Howard, Louisa!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, I'm gonna start wearing a hat when I get my hair cut too.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, What is wrong with you? You knew that Ron Howard was Rebel Alley's father?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Yes, everyone does. I didn't realize that's who you thought the other man was. But the good news is, at least one of our projects is still going, which... By the way, I haven't signed this yet. Should I?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Yes. Absolutely. Thank you.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Okay. My movie rights... Tobias Onyango Fünke.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Initial down here.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, This is exciting!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Michael, Thank you. (rips up contract) You're out of the movie.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, Tobias was defeated.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," And the most important thing, you must never be distracted."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," Without the play, he'd lose DeBrie from his life, but he'd made his bed and had no choice but to lie in it."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle, He's back!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, I got the rights. We're gonna make a musical.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, Or just lie.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Yay!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Yay!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Yay!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Yay!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Both, Yay... (nervous laughter)
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, (singing) I don't want to be... invisible!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,All, (singing) Invisible! 
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," And so the group went into their final rehearsal process, and although DeBrie still had butterflies, and worms... "
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, (singing) Invisible!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,All, (singing) Invisible!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, (singing) Invisible!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,All, (singing) Invisible! Invisible - Fantastic Four.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," ...the play did have a new backer, who had a few notes."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Yes. (applauds)
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lucille, Is anyone going to tell her she needs to lose weight? Because I'm not buying invisible. And you don't want to be out there on a raft that's listing.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle, (singing) I can reach you...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, (singing) No one can reach me...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle, (singing) I can reach you...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," Yes, Lucille had found someone to mother."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, No one can reach me.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lucille," ""No one can reach me""? Is that how she's going to say that line? ""No one can reach me""? "
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, I...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, But all the pressure was compelling DeBrie to think about a slip.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,All, (singing) Even if my heart won't snap back into place - Fantastic Four.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lucille, Maybe they should re-title this Fantastic Three and Lousy One.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, That's my bad... (falls off stage)
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Oh, DeBrie!"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie," Or ankle or... knee. I think I, I need some drugs."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," No, it's okay, that's okay, no drugs are necessary. We all want drugs, but that's a no-no, yes?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," And soon it was the night of their big show, and Tobias and his ragtag troupe of substance abusers showed up for their big moment on stage."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lucille," In case you didn't know, the stage adds seven pounds. Two words. Diet pills."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, (whispering) Do you have any?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Lucille, please. Okay, Fan Four, company meeting? Now, I know everybody has made a commitment to stay in the program for at least 30 more days, but I think we can all afford one night of intense pressure, yes?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle," We're all hoofers, we can take the pressure, huh?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Argyle! Not helping, okay. Does anybody have any questions?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Emmett," Yeah, I got a question. You're sure the Hispanic community is okay with all of this?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Hmm. I'm sure they think of this as an homage, yes. Okay, we'll, I'm going to go put on my rock monster outfit and pass out some fliers. You can take any boat to the float."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Tobias! I don't think I can do this.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," You can do anything I want you to do. And, and you... want to do as well. We need this. This will make all our old dreams come true."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, But maybe they're old for a reason.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Oh, you're... focusing on the wrong... words. If we can get through tonight, DeBrie, we can get through anything. All right? Don't worry about it. The audience will be completely drunk, and if we're not perfect... they'll take it out on us, but... that's why you're going to be perfect! You have to be perfect. Okay. All right."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, But Tobias was about to discover a situation that was less than perfect.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Kid #1, Fantastic Four!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Kid #2, Fantastic Four!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," What? Oh, no."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Kid #3, Fantastic Four!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Who would bring kids here? This is no place for- (to passing kids) I'm a registered sex offender. All right. I'm a registered- I'm a registered sex offender. I'm a registered sex offender. Tobias Fünke, registered sex offender, registered sex offender, registered sex offender, registered sex offender, registered sex offender."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, Tobias knew that wearing the Thing outfit would only make him more recognizable.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Kid #4, Fantastic Four!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, DeBrie was also at a loss.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie," Okay, okay."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," Feeling frightened and fragile, she tried to keep it together in a very slippery place."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Water.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," And she probably would have made it, if the calming waves she was looking at weren't down-current from where Doctor Norman was flushing away the remains of his medical career. And so DeBrie, who had been in the safe harbor of a drug-free zone, found herself in the free-drug zone of an unsafe harbor. And that's when fate dealt Tobias a new hand."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Buster! Oh, thank God. I need your help. I've got a show to do in 10 minutes, and I haven't got a thing to wear. This Thing suit..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, And that's how Buster was drafted to be in Tobias's musical.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," It's all pre-recorded, and the dance is simplicity itself. You're a monster! You don't have to be any good."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Buster, What?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, It wasn't a great choice of words.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Butch it up and ""Thing"" your heart out."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," Having recast the Thing, Tobias returned to check on his leading lady."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, DeBrie! DeBrie?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Ha. No, I'm looking for a woman named DeBrie. (sees her in the pile) DeBrie!"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Fantastic Four!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Have you been drinking?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, No... it's pills.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Oh... how could you do this to me? Or did I do this to you?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, You to me.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," I should have left you happy and healthy and sober in that rehab, instead of trying to rekindle the career that brought you there in the first place."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lucille 2, Is she drunk?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Uh, no..."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, It's pills!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Ehh...
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lucille 2, Can I talk to you for a second?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Yes, uh, yes, yes."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lucille 2, That is unacceptable. Patients doing pills on a literal pile of garbage? That's not what we're about at Austerity. Where's Argyle? It's his addicts-
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," I, I, I can't let you blame Argyle for this. It would destroy his confidence, and... he's a little shaky on the lyrics as it is. (whispering) He's not very good."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lucille 2," Fine, then I blame you. Someone has to pay for this. You're putting Austerity in jeopardy. You're out!"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," No, don't fire me, I, I'm on a work-release program. If you fire me then I have to go back to prison. I can't go to prison. And you're investing in this show. What if we get killer notices?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Lucille 2," We'll talk about it on Monday. Now, get rid of her before someone sees her with a camera phone. You know they have those nowadays."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," So I've got until Monday to fix this. (laughs menacingly) That red-haired lady can't throw her wad at that guy... Oh, DeBrie."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," But on the other side of the dumpster, things hadn't been so laughable."

4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Yeah.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Jonah Feinberg," What is the play, honey?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie," Fantastic Three and Lousy One, so... Four!"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Jonah Feinberg, Four?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Yeah.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Jonah Feinberg, And who do you play?
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Sue Storm.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Jonah Feinberg," Okay, Sue Storm and the Fantastic Four are both trademarked by the Marvel Entertainment LLC. This is a cease and desist letter. If you violate it, you will go to prison for a long, long time. And you certainly can't wear a four in a logo."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," In fact, it wasn't even Marvel that owned the four in a circle. It was trademarked by the Four Feinbergs."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Jonah Feinberg," Hey, can anyone just throw one of those little Mexican guitars off the dock?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, I don't want to go to prison!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Jonah Feinberg, I'm going to do it.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Well, Lucille 2 has threatened me with prison, but it's going to take more than one prison threat... Oh. You got one too. Well, universe, you see to be putting up all sorts of walls between me and my dreams. ...Today. Well, if we have any chance of beating this, it's by putting on the best show possible. A real wowzer! I just need to find a Sue Storm. (takes DeBrie's wig) I guess I'll need this... Before I go any further with this, there's no way a hot cup of coffee and a glass of the show must go on spirit will encourage you in any way, will it?"
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,DeBrie, Let me die. (slumps)
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, No. You're not in any shape to go out and perform tonight.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," Tobias knew he couldn't leave DeBrie in the trash in a high-trafficked area, but also knew he had a show to put on. And so he went off to search for any Sue Storm in the port. And when the search proved unsuccessful, he ended up finding one inside himself."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, Time to channel my inner Storm.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," And because he didn't have the costume, he created one out of some make-up he'd always had in case he got a call. "
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, And perhaps it was his muscle memory that led to this.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias," Tobias, what are you doing? (turning as man enters) Oh, pardon the mess. I just blue myself for the first time in five years."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, (high-pitched) Excuse me. Make way for Sue Storm.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," And now the almost-invisible Invisible Girl got on the boat to head to the floating stage. Unfortunately, and not for the first time, Tobias got on the wrong boat.  Except this one was piloted by a man who not only expected a woman in disguise... but also had a real bad case of face-blindness."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Crowd, Put! Up! This! Wall! Put! Up! This! Wall! Put! Up! This! Wall!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," And as it turned out, the woman he was expecting had just given a rousing speech and joined the Love campaign as they took the message that Marky had vowed to torpedo to the sea."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Crowd, Put! Up! This! Wall! Put! Up! This! Wall! Put! Up! This! Wall! Put! Up! This! Wall!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Tobias, I think this is going to make quite a splash.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Marky Bark," Oh, I know it is."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator, On the next Arrested Development.
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," After weeks of rehearsal, it becomes clear that the unauthorized Fantastic Four musical does not look like it's going to Broadway."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Narrator," But since they worked so hard, we're going to run credits over it."
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Emmett, The only thing that can destroy me. Water!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Argyle, Nice ad-lib!
4,Smashed,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Smashed,Emmett, Not an ad-lib - I can't swim!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Announcer," Meet the Jade Dragon Triad. They take no prisoners, because they are prisoners - at the Orange County Correctional Facility L.I.T.E."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Announcer," They're the ruling gang in this four-star hellhole, and the Real Asian Prison Housewives of the Orange County White Collar Prison System."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Noh," We are a gang. We stick together. Uh-huh. Although, right now, one of our members is a real B-word. We're getting ready to do something about it."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Olive Garden," She come in and quickly become leader. And we get so sick of her bossy, bossy behavior. And now she got to go."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Mrs. Oh," In civilian life, we'd just vote Lu out. But here, she's gonna end up on the wrong end of a noodle. Uncooked. You get me?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Ignore them. Their bark is louder than the dogs they eat back home. And I got news for them. Anyone who comes after me is going to be one unfortunate cookie. (laughs) I made a pun.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," Years before her behavior had become ""bossy, bossy"" with the Jade Dragon Triad, Lucille was fleeing the SEC..."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Full steam, boys!"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, ...when she got a call.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Hello, Lucille, I still hope you're coming to our little get-together."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille 2," You want to hear something funny? I never got an invitation! But I feel like I'm there, because it's all over the news. Oh, honey, is that you? I'm on my deck waving to you. But with those police boats following you, I guess I'm waving goodbye."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Well, you must be mistaken, because I can't see you, and you're usually as hard to miss as Liberace wearing a fright wig."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille 2," Oh, goodness, that is you! I'm practically counting your crow's feet."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Oh, well, maybe I should turn back and show you another bird. (Lucille 2 hangs up) He-hello? Did you hear me say that about the bird? Hello?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," But it was clear that Lucille 2 hadn't heard it. So, in a fit of what sailors call ""sea rage"", she turned back to show her the bird."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Coming about. Coming about. Coming about, boys!"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, But Lucille 2 wasn't the only thing that got flipped that day.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,John Beard," (on TV) None of which would have happened if it had continued out to sea. But then the Queen changed course, heading back to shore, before crashing into the jetty in what can only be described as a ""sail-past"" gone wrong."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And that's when they got some good news from Barry.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Barry," First of all, won't be cheap. It's gonna cost you a fortune in legal fees."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr.", What's the good news?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, Correction. Good news for Barry.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Barry," From your perspective, I can see where you think it's all bad news. It's all bad news."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, Although he did have one good suggestion.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Barry," Ha - you're going away for a long time, unless we can come up with a good alibi."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster, Mother! I fell in the ocean. Why didn't you come for me?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, And there it is.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster, What?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," I did, Buster."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster, What?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Tell them how you were drowning and I commandeered the ship to save you. Tell them what I did. (winks) The truth.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster," Okay. She stole the Queen Mary to get away from the SEC. Oh, and she winked. Correction, it's a glare. (laughs) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr.", What's going on?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Hey!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster," What are you doing? Wait, where are you going? Where are you going? Wait, she doesn't have her make-up, I have her lipstick! Bring her back! Come on- uh..."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," But Buster knew that lipstick wasn't the only thing she'd be without. So, after she was released to await trial under house arrest, he made sure she was able to catch up on what she missed."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, This is the same scene I came back to after Cancún four years ago.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And after devising their plan to build the wall...
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Our wall. We build the wall.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, ...it was decided that George Senior should move out...
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr.", We build that sucker...
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, That's my Georgie! 
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, ...in order to make their fake divorce look real.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr.", ...five miles high.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," This fake divorce has got to look real. After the trial, you can move back in. It's only a trial separation. (laughs) Made a pun! Even in this time of stress."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr.", D'you think you're gonna be... okay alone with Buster?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, If I need a moment to myself I'll step out on the balcony.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," Your ankle bracelet, it's gonna go off."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, So I'll make him stand on the balcony. He's happiest when he feels useful.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," Soon, he was practically delirious."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, There was one bright spot when they simultaneously stumbled on a term they both secretly recognized...
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Man, (on TV) ...and now it's time to take this hot mess of a skirt...
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, ...would be useful in their future disagreements.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Man,(on TV) ...and my model is...
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, (mouthing) Hot mess.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Man,"(on TV) ...I'm covered with glue, and I'm, like, ""This is a hot mess!"""
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster, (mouthing) Hot mess.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," But as her trial grew closer, it was getting harder for Lucille not to alienate her alibi."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster, Here's your breakfast.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," This toast has hook holes. Again! I told you to get rid of that thing. It's hideous. Plus, what's gonna happen when they swear you in? You're gonna rip the bible in half! The jury'll love that."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster," You're getting pretty snippy to your key witness, aren't you?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, What do you want?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster, Maybe you could hook me up with a little stimmy. (gestures with hook) Lil' stimmy.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Are you trying to do this? (rubs fingers together)
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster, Yes! And I want stimmy to get a hook that'll do that.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," When no such hook was available, Lucille found other means to mollify her alibi. Both of which were unveiled at a family meeting."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr.", (to Michael) You're the key witness in your mother's trial.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster," Wait, I thought I was the key witness."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, You're the star witness.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster, Oh.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Because it was your life I was going after to save. He fell off the boat. He'll tell you in my own words.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster, Uhh. (mumbling) Homosexuals kidnapped...
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Up, up, up."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster," (stands) Homosexuals kidnapped the boat and took it on a joy ride. Mother didn't want to trample their rights, so she let 'em. Then she realized that her son fell off the boat and into the water, and she went back. Oh, and a fish swam by my ankle. That really happened. Should I keep that?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Make it an eel.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster, Okay. (shouting) It's gonna be an eel!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Barry, Better.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," But alone with Buster, the tension grew worse, and things came to a head the night before the trial."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Just don't understand why I can't sleep in my own bed the night before the trial. Buster! I'm going to exhale.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster," No, please. I've had like seven in the past half hour."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, You're not the one staring five years in the face.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster," Well, right now I'm staring at a hundred years in the face!"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, How dare you? (to cop) Would you mind? (he leaves)
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster," Be careful, defendant. Remember who you're talking to. It sure would be a shame if something happened to your pretty little key witness."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Star witness. And are you threatening yourself?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster, Maybe I am.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," And losing confidence in her star witness, Lucille decided to take a few keepsakes with her in case things didn't go her way."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And that's when she discovered that the family she believed supported her had actually already begun divvying up her stuff in case she lost.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Oh. And he's supposed to be the good one. This does not bode well for tomorrow.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," Actually, they'd claimed those things years earlier when she was having a sun spot checked. But she was right to worry about the turnout for the trial."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Judge Kornzucker, Does the defense have a witness they'd like to call? Any witness?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Please tell me you're working on a strategy for us.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Barry," Oh. It's us now? Well, we have Lucille Austero. She's the only one who showed. I don't think that is good for us."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Nonsense. She owns the company now. She's got as much to lose as I do. And she's a dear friend. I'll... do it myself, though. I need this to go well."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," And so it was Lucille who did the questioning of her new star witness, Lucille 2."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Barry, We would like to call Lucille Austero.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Thank you so much for coming to be my witness. You're such a large shareholder... Oh. I've made a pun!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille 2," Oh, how could I not do it for my oldest friend? Oh! Now I've gone and done a double. (both laugh)"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, A double. Like your pre-surgery chin.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille 2," Or your post-breakfast drink. Oh, I wish you'd come to my rehab clinic. But, anything to help that Keystone Kop family of yours."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Keystone Kops. Your references are as fresh as the wallpaper in the room of that pretend child you've had all these years. But, my friend..."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille 2," You're right, I shouldn't joke. None of your family showed up, you poor thing. This is such a black mark on all of you."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, You should know about black marks. Your pillow must look like a Rorschach Test. (laughing) Not that there'd be anyone to see it.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille 2," So, as I was saying..."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," But unfortunately, their thirty year passive-aggressive dance was losing some of its passive."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," As if everybody in this room couldn't tell how jealous and conniving you are, my dear Lucille Austero."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille 2, What I knew was that you were stealing for years. We all did! That's why nobody was surprised when you stole that boat.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, And I knew you couldn't wait to get your liver-spotted claws into my company.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille 2, Says the woman whose liver can be spotted from outer space!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, No further questions!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille 2, No further answers!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Am I done?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Barry, Oh... that's got to be a treasure chest.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, You think that went well?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Barry, (covering up puzzle placemat) I do.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, The judge kept Lucille on ice while she awaited the verdict.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, (shivering) Have you heard anything?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Crab Shack Worker," Well, our cashier's pregnant, and she's not married, so..."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, I mean about me.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Crab Shack Worker," Oh, you're guilty. Three to five."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, Lucille was checking in to her new home.

4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, It was one of the so-called country club prisons...

4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, ...that had become popular after the Enron debacle.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Receptionist," You want to go here, so you're gonna take this hallway to the elevators and then you're gonna want to..."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Slow down. You sound like the end of a Cymbalta commercial.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Receptionist, Even the lifers get confused. Don't worry...
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," Even though it was a nice prison, it was still prison."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Receptionist," You have a choice of fresh scent, sport or floral for your delousing. Also, if you're sexually assaulted by a guard..."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, A $20 gratuity is appreciated?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Receptionist," (laughs) No, but press seven on your phone. If you go through the front desk, it'll take forever."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," After Lucille got settled in, she received a visitor."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," You missed my trial, George. How could you?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr.", I told you I was sorry. I was unconscious on the sweat lodge floor. I lost two days.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," I'm losing three to five years. And those are the last years, George, the best years, where you can have sex and not worry about getting pregnant."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," All right, here's the good news. They only got you on stealing the boat, they didn't even touch us on the financial stuff. You're gonna get outta here!"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," When? Better be before the money runs out, this place isn't cheap."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," I know, and you are running up those spa bills."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, The same girl who hands me towels does the cavity checks. You tip.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," Barry says he can get your sentence reduced, if... you agree to leave here and go to Lucille 2's rehab clinic."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," That's the bitch that put me here. And I'm not going to fake having some sort of, I don't know, alcohol problem just so that sterile cuckoo bird can laugh at me."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," I figured. Okay. I have another idea. Now, you know China Garden?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, I know the one by the harbor.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," No, this one's a person. And that one closed. China Garden's aunt, Olive, is very well connected with the Jade Triad gang. It's a prison gang here. And believe me, they will protect you."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, That's a gang? I thought they were tech support.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," It turned out they were a gang, and thanks to China Garden, Lucille was admitted as a probationary member."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Mrs. Oh, You play mahjong before?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Our beach club used to have a Jewish day. Your move, Olive Garden."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Olive Garden, I can't concentrate. Playing mahjong without cigarette is like playing video poker without... cigarette.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Noh, Why are we not allowed to smoke in this stupid prison?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And that's when Lucille made her move.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, I know a loophole.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Olive Garden," Ah? ""Roop hore""?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,All, Roop hore. Rope hore. Rope hore? Rope hore?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, It was a move that would get Lucille accepted as a full-fledged member of the Jade Dragon Triad.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Mrs. Oh, You couldn't have chosen a harder word to say.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And soon the Dragons were taking drags on their cigarettes again.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, There's always a way to get what you want.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Olive Garden," My husband is a very powerful man, Lucille Bluth. Perhaps we can help each other get what we want."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And that's how Lucille found a deep-pocketed investor to help build the wall.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," I got Olive Garden to offer us unlimited bread. Who better than the Chinese to help us build a wall, right?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," So, the Chinese will own a piece of the wall between the U.S. and Mexico?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," They'll own all of it, but they'll make us very rich in the process. We just need to get Michael to sign a release. He sold his shares, but he could still claim that he deserves a piece. Or worse, find out and blow the whistle. Where the hell did we go wrong with that kid?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," Probably where we went wrong with the others, I don't know... I like the plan, I just wonder if we're not in that treason-adjacent space where the, uh, government will, will retaliate and... execute us."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Oh, they'd never execute a woman for this. I have a good feeling about these people."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr.", Oh. That's good enough for me. (hangs up and starts to sob)
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," But the change in the economy led the government to put the wall project on hold. And as the months passed and the Chinese saw no progress on the wall, tension mounted."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Mrs. Oh, What?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And Lucille was getting more controlling.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," She said you're fat. That's what you said, right? Or does that mean something different in Chinese?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Noh," No, it means fat."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Olive Garden," You keep causing trouble, you're going to end up with noodles in you belly. (makes stabbing motion)"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, I like noodles.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Olive Garden," Not this way, very hard to digest."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Ancient Chinese secret, huh?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Mrs. Oh," It's no secret, we'll kill you."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, She was even being controlling of the R.A.P.H.O.C.W.P.S. reality TV crew.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Did you get that? Do you need a clean of her making the threat? I can lean back, but you will come around and get my reaction, yes?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Mrs. Oh," Oh, I'll say it again. We'll kill you."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," But soon, the threat was made real."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, We're playing mahjong!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Mrs. Oh, Hello.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Noh, Oh! She's got a sharpened noodle.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, She's trying to noodle-stab me.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Aah!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Mrs. Oh, My eye!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, This'll be even more exciting if you jump cut it.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Olive Garden, Quiet! You can't just come in and have bread for nothing around here. You have to pay bill some time.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, It wasn't a great time to find out George didn't own the right property to build the wall on. And so a new plan emerged.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Look, we make sure Herbert Love comes out against the wall - right after we get enough of it up to trigger the government payment."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," They needed the government to kill the wall completely, but pay them anyway."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," As much as I'd like to stay and lay some more pipe with you, I better get moving on this thing."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," We've got to make this wall work, George. We know Lucille 2 will oppose it. We just have to make sure Herbert Love does."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," Oh, don't worry. That's why I asked Michael for help."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Michael? What are you bringing Michael into this for? The only thing he should be doing is signing over his rights to the company.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, I asked him to do this as well.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, He made it a condition of the now four-favor family pact.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," He's doing it, he's doing it. Will you please relax?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," Do something for me. You know, your mother is very hurt. You haven't visited her. It's like you have given up on the family business."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, I have.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," Yes, but not in writing. To protect all of us, visit her, sign a little something saying it's all hers. Will you do this, Michael?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, Yeah. But I get to make you look bad in the movie.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr.", Okay.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, Should we settle up?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," All right. Who owes what, what to who?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, I want this first...
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Send me some evidence of a wall I can show the Chinese. And the government. We need to make this happen, George. The Chinese have more than a sharpened noodle with my name on it."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," And days later, that evidence arrived from George Senior."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," We've built this wall! We have miles and, and miles of wall. Uh..."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," Here's more wall, uh..."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster, (outside trailer) Daddy! Daddy!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," And you know, it feels good to be protecting our, our border."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," My God, he Steamboat Willie-d it."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr.", It's a heart project.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Buster, Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr.", We love America.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And that's when Lucille noticed something worrisome.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, It seemed her prison family was preparing for her to disappear as well. So Lucille took matters into her own hands.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,G.O.B.," (on phone) Well, that was fast, you hot little-"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, It's your mother.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,G.O.B.," Hi. Sorry, I, I thought you were somebody else. I can't tell you who, 'cause I'm... dating... someone... famous."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," You better start to build this wall, pronto. I tried with your father, but he can't do it."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,G.O.B.," Well, I'm kind of busy now. I'm working with Michael."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, What are you working on with Michael?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,G.O.B., Dad made him give me a job.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," I see, so he thought it was a good idea to have you two together... Isn't that nice? My God, is there anyone there with half a brain that can help me with this?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,G.O.B.," I don't know about half a brain, but Tobias is living with me right now and he's not very bright. Although he is working in the rehab where Lucille 2 is."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, He is? 
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And that's when Lucille came up with a plan to get transferred away from the Jade Dragon Triad.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Hire a crew and start the wall. And not a word to your brother. I'm getting a transfer.It's time for Mama to put on the old drunk act.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,G.O.B., That was an...?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," After a call to Lucille 2's rehab center, where her drunk act was as good as anything you'd see at the Method One Clinic..."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Hi, Lushille Bluth, Lushille 2 pleashe. (sighs) Fine, Lucille Austero."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, ...Lucille was admitted as a patient and soon met the therapist who held the keys to her freedom.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias, I must say that I'm thrilled that you've chosen me.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, You look great. That suit looks very hetero on you.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," Well, thank you. You look very hetero as well. Now... how are you?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," I'm as normal as blueberry pie. So write that down on a form, sign me out, I won't have to go back to prison, and maybe you'll find a new car parked in your driveway. (winks)"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," Ew... Yes, well, it, it doesn't work that way. We have to have a series of sessions, and, uh, I have to swear in the best of my professional opinion that you have accepted and made every effort at thoughtfully reflecting upon your weaknesses."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Yes! Write down that I did that.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," Well, no, I, I don't work that way."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, You don't work any way. This is your first paying job in 10 years.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," Oh, no, no, this doesn't pay. This is part of a work release program. The state of California thinks that I'm a sex offender, D- don't worry about what the state of California thinks. The point is we have a chance to be honest with ourselves."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Fine. You don't look heterosexual in that suit. You look as swishy as Ryan Seacrest.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias, Ryan Seacrest is straight.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, And I'm 40! Sign the form.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias, Well! At least we have a dialog going.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Dialog? If you don't release me, you've heard the last I'm going to say to you in these sessions."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," Fine, but you will have to sit with me for the full session. Every single session. Now, Lucille, I can't make you talk. But you know what I can do? (silence) Hmm? (silence) Okay, I can't trick you into talking, either."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, This went on for several sessions.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," Perhaps that's why they call this place Aus-stare-ity. ...No? (silence) Aus-stare-it... Fine. Well, if you're not going to talk, I'm just going to... write this up."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," Earlier that day, Tobias had encountered a plot problem with the Fantastic Four musical."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Argyle, One thing we could use. A villain.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," I was thinking the same thing. I mean, why aren't the Fantastic Four fighting anyone?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Argyle," Instead of just dancing around, you mean?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," Right, it's like it's all Sharks and no Jets."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Argyle, Then we would have a second act.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Emmett," Lucia, right? I mean, that's their foe. Lucia von Bardas? Have you guys ever even read one of these things?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias, How much would it cost to do this right? I mean really right.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, So Tobias was glad for the break in Lucille's sessions so he could work on it.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias, This woman is a villain.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, You think I'm a villain too?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias, N-
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," My children are all waiting for me to die so they can divvy up my stuff, my Chinese gang mates were getting ready to noodle stab me, and even one of the guards called me ""Gangie,"" and he was talking about the monster movie. He thinks that horrible monster looks like me. So fine, you want to call me a villain, I accept it! I'm your villain!"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," Uh, actually I was writing down a casting breakdown for the role of Lucia for my Fantastic Four musical."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," This was all about your stupid play? I was about to cry for the first time in 60 years. I remember when the last time was, too. I hid under Mama's porch during a thunderstorm, and I found the remains of my-"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," It's not a stupid play, it's a musical. And I have to debut it on a boat at Cinco."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, It's on a boat?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Young Barry, (in flashback) Take to the sea!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," Yes, I'll sign everyone out for the night, but I guess I'll have to play the old sea bitch myself."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, I'm in.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," Really? Well, that's wonderful. Well, I think we have made a breakthrough today. I-in the musical. Not you. Oh, God, no, there's miles of work to do with you."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," But, of course, he would make her audition. So Lucille wrote a song from the heart."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," (singing) My children despise me, my husband defies me, it doesn't surprise me - the hell with them all! I'll put up a wall! You think I'm a villain, a villain I'll be - my heart is in pain, I just want to flee... from me!"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias, Wonderful.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Argyle, Terrifying.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," Isn't she? Betty, you can leave. Lucille, would you please stay?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, But staying was the last thing Lucille had in mind.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Hello?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar," I want to be with you, I... I have needs."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," George, is that you?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," It wasn't. It was Oscar, who, living as George and feeling more amorous..."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, went to visit Lucille 2 for an afternoon delight.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar, (whistles) Lucille?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," When she wasn't there, he found her work number."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Woman, (on phone) Austerity?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar," Lucille... 2, please?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," But, of course, at Austerity, this woman is Lucille 2."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Hello?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar," I want to be with you, I... I have needs."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," George, is that you?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," But a newly virile Oscar figured, in a pinch, any Lucille would do."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar," Yes, this is George. Where are you?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," I'm in rehab, you know that."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar," Why don't I swing by, and we can conjugate?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Let's do our business over the phone.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar," May not have a lot of time, but, uh, all right, here goes. I want to pull your panties off with my..."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Real business, George."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar," (businesslike tone) I'd very much like to pull your underwear off with my, my teeth..."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, No.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar," Okay, okay."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," At Cinco, we're getting on a boat, we're leaving the country."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar, But what about love?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Easy. Gene Parmesan got photos of Herbert Love with some redheaded whore. I'm giving his wife a taste so he knows we know. If he wins, we should be able to get him to do whatever we want with that wall now."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar, I'm not completely following...
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Oh, hold on."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And that's when Lucille finally had a visit from her son.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Hello?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Man, (on phone) Michael Bluth here to see you.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Send him up.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar, ...with my teeth.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Michael's here.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar," Oh, okay."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, This is my chance to make sure he doesn't get too cozy with G.O.B.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar, Why?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Bad things happen when brothers collude.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar, When can we have sex?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, After Cinco.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar, Cinco?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Just get a boat ready. We'll make our getaway.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar," So, not... not today."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And that's when she saw Michael for the first time since the last time he left the family.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, Thank you very much... Hello there! Thank you. Wow! This is a step up from prison.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, How would you know? You haven't come to visit me once.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," Yeah, sorry, I... feel bad about that."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," So, you're here to make amends? Because you know your mother will always take you back."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, And because I know my mother wants me to sign away any connection to the family business.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, I just need a signature.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, I'm happy to help... if you do something-
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Both, -for me.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Yeah, I heard that's been happening. I'm happy to help you, honey."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, Me too.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And that's how Michael got his mother's rights to the movie. But not right away.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, So happy to help.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Me too. So, everything else is good?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, Yeah.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," You've talked to your sister, the radical?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," Yeah. She's a redhead now, and she's dating Herbert Love, but other than her looks and her belief system, she's the same old Lindsay."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Ah... So that's Lindsay in the photo. I hear you're dating an actress - who's also dating Ron Howard?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," Haha. No-no, no, no, no, no, no, no. She is not dating Ron Howard, Mother. Ron Howard is her father. Okay? (chuckles) Your mind... I did, though, actually find out who she is dating."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," Michael had found out earlier that day, when he visited her apartment to head off any ill feelings she might have about this..."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Ron Howard, I'll do everything in my power to make sure she never dates you again.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, Or this.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," (strangling Howard) You are ruining my life, Ron Howard!"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," Nice, right?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Housekeeper, Is... too big. She likes... small. (points at single flower in vase)
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lem, May I please have ice-cream?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Housekeeper," (leaving) No, no, you are Depardieu. No sweets."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," Getting excited about Cinco? Your Cinco, not ours. "
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, Michael wasn't proud of what he was about to do.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," Hey, Lem, I can reach the ice-cream, and, you know, in my family, we play a game called ""If You Do Something for Me."""
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," Rules are meant to be broken, huh? I will give you this Dove bar if you do something for me."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lem, We have Dove bars?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, We do. Look at that. Tell me what you know about this... George Maharis.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lem, Not much. He's old.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, Is he older than me?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lem, Few years. He looks like you.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," So, handsome."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And that's when Lucille found a way to keep the brothers from colluding.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, George Maharis. George. That's your brother's name. George Oscar Bluth.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," Yes, uh, George is G.O.B.'s... first name, yep."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And that's when Michael remembered something else strange.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, I probably should have expected that.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," And then, stranger."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, Love each other.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Oh, that definitely sounds like Gob. And he did say he was seeing someone famous..."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,G.O.B.," I thought you were somebody else. I can't tell you who, 'cause I'm... dating... someone... famous."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And Michael remembered hearing about that as well.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias, Me doth think he hath a lady.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, Oh.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias, And they're both bit of a celebrities.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," Well, that is odd, because I, I'm also dating a celebrity."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, If I were you I'd put a tail on him. Get a P.I.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, Where the hell am I gonna find a P.I.?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Gene Parmesan," Gene Parmesan, at your service."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," (screams) Aah, it's Gene! He does this to me every time!"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," What's he doing here, Mom?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Oh, he's working for me."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," Why'd you scream, then?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, I thought he was that guy! (points at young African-American guy)
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, Hmm.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," At Lucille's behest, Michael borrowed the family P.I. to follow his brother."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Gene Parmesan, He just drove by. Pick me up.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," This is the great disguise, huh? Fry cook!"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Gene Parmesan," Oh, no, no. This is my horrible night job. In fact, I was hoping you could drop me off at Chicken Dan's when we're all done."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," Chicken Dan's, huh? That is embarrassing."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Gene Parmesan," This from a man who's driving around a mapping car? You know, I don't even think these things work. That's why I rely on these babies right here. The ol' binocs. Let's see if we can't find this target. You know, the great thing about these is there's no software to update. (gags)"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," Oh, God, what are you doing?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Gene Parmesan, Sorry. Oh. These binoculars make me nauseous.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," Well, of course they do. Why don't you just use the maps? We're riding in a satellite-linked mapping car."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Gene Parmesan," No, no, sometimes the old ways are the... (gags)"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael, Hey.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Gene Parmesan," You, you better pull over."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Michael," All right, hang on."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Gene Parmesan, Pull over!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," And while Michael was waylaid, Lucille was working on her tap dancing."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," (singing gruffly) You look down on Thing, but that is 'cause you haven't heard me sing... (lifts off mask)"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Hey, ex- excuse me. Excuse-"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias, (singing) When I was a little bitty boy-
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Excuse me.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, Correction - her tap dancing...
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, She missed a step. Tell her she missed a step. She can't do it like that.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, ...on people's feelings.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," Oh, uh, DeBrie, you might have missed a step, so..."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,DeBrie," Sorry, I think I might... I hurt my... leg. And so, I need some Tylenol with codeine. Or maybe a little morphie morph."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," No, DeBrie, come on. Don't you want to get back on that horse?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,DeBrie, Even better!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," She was the best villain casting since Shirley MacLaine in Gangie 4. And on the night of Cinco, Lucille's escape plans got a step closer to completion. Oscar did indeed borrow a boat and left it idling - which, unfortunately, was what this man was looking for."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And Lucille slipped away from the cast looking for her husband.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, There you are!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr.", What are you doing here? 
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," What do you mean, what am I doing here? We made plans to escape on the boat!"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr.", I never made plans with you.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, We talked about it on the phone when you were trying to talk dirty to me.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr.", Oh.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, What is wrong with you?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," This is, this is embarrassing. Full disclosure. Uh, that was Oscar who may have been the one you were talking with. He's been filling in... for me occasionally."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Filling in? As in, visiting me? You sent your brother to have sex with me?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," No. I sent him to listen to you one time, and then he found out about the wall and tried to get you talking about it, and this was his way of shutting you up."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, He told you this.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr."," No, you told me when I visited. I... got in there a couple of times... too. But not for sex. I just don't have the tiger in my tank anymore. Maybe I do need a vacay. So, tell me about this trip. That's interesting. Where we going?"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, I'll tell you where we're going. We're going to court. We're getting a real divorce. You're out of the marriage.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,"George, Sr.", Lucille?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And that's when she came face to face with the man whose face she'd just faced.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar, Are you ready?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, But it was a different-
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Hello, Oscar."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, -it was Oscar.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," You should get an Oscar for your portrayal of George in ""Screw the Oblivious Sister-in-law""."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar," I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You got me. I was gonna tell you. I was acting when I pretended to be George, but I am dead serious when I say you are the hottest woman I know. I'm here tonight because I want to run away with you."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Oscar. Really?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar," Of course. What, do you think I'm here for the donkey punch? Which I do love, and it's the only night you can get it, but you are the only woman for me, Lucille!"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Bring me those thin, pot-stained lips."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar," Oh, honey."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, What's this?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And that's when she found the latest thing that was hers that had been claimed.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, He'd actually acquired it earlier that night when he was... polling for Lucille 2.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, She's claimed you. Everyone I know wants to take everything away from me.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar," No! That's not true. I love you. I don't know if it's the maca, I've just been so randy lately. But you're... You... You're my kind of Lucille."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Get away from me, you liar. I can't believe you were with her. She's finished. And the Oscar goes too."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Oscar, To...?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Get out of my sight!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, She was in an emotional storm and could have used a therapist...
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Oh, my God."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias, Lucille! Wh-where are you going?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, ...when she ran into a therapist who could have used a Storm.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, To disappear. That's what everybody wants me to do.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias, Lucille. You are not the villain.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, I'm so tired of being the villain.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," Well, those days are over. What you are is the Invisible Girl. You make it impossible for people to see you in order to protect yourself."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," And somehow, in that moment, something changed for her."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, I do do that.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," And this way, you launch sneak attacks and you create a force field to keep people away."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille, Right! I'm not a villain. I'm the Invisible Girl!
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," Yes, that's what I'm saying!"
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Lucille," Oh, you know, it's funny - I never would have come to this if it hadn't been for Lucille 2's rehab. I need to pay her back for everything she's done to me. I'm going back to rehab. I just have to make one quick stop first."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias, I don't think we have time. Do you want to change into the wig-?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And that's the night that Lucille decided she didn't want to be invisible anymore.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias, I've got to do this.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," And perhaps, ironically, it was also the night that Lucille 2 became the invisible girl."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator," On the next Arrested Development. Tobias boards the boat originally meant for Lucille's escape, and after making one stop, faces the awful truth."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Marky Bark, (laughing) They're gonna be talking about this bomb for years.
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias," God, it is bad, isn't it? Lindsay was right to discourage me."
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Marky Bark, Tobias?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias, Marky?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Marky Bark, If you're not Lindsay then where is Lindsay?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Tobias, Isn't that her on the Love boat?
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Marky Bark, But I just put a bomb on the Love boat!

4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Narrator, And it turns out to be kind of romantic...
4,Queen B.,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Queen_B.,Marauder, Bomb!

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., (on the phone) And then thanks for the birthday card that I never got from you for the last 40 years.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator,  In fact it was a brother with whom G.O.B...
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., What the hell?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, ...was secretly competitive.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I got the right of way."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., No.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, Okay. Haha!
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And perhaps it was that sense of competition that led to this tinkling match.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., I've met someone. Can't really give you any information. Kind of famous-y.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, I also met someone.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., Have you?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, Also famous-y. Can't give you any information.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., Is it Julie Bowen?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," No, it's not. Is yours Julie Bowen?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.,"  No, is yours Julie...? Oh, my God, Michael, you're seeing Julie Bowen?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," I am not seeing Julie Bowen, but if you are, you tell me right now."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," I want to hear you say the words, ""I'm not seeing Julie Bowen."""
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, I have not seen Julie Bowen.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Well, that's a funny way to phrase it."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, This went on for some time...
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, So no one is seeing Julie Bowen.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., No one...
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, ...but eventually they started talking business.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," If it wasn't for the movie thing, I would do it myself. They practically sell themselves, you just got to bring the people in."

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, But soon the hard lemonade softened their competitive edge.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," No, no, this... maybe Tobias?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And Michael confessed that he had grown estranged from his son.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Well, then, take him to the Ealing Club."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, I don't know if I could pick up the phone and call him and ask him...
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., I'll call him for you. You've given me a new sense of purpose.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," I, I don't want you to get your hopes up. You know, when I said that, that these places sell themselves, I, I should have gone on to say, you know, that, that... No, they don't."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," No, I'm not talking about selling these mausoleums. I mean destroying Tony Wonder. I'm gonna destroy his career the same way that he destroyed mine."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, G.O.B. was referring to an escape act he'd performed that had failed when the hidden compartment that held the keys to his escape hadn't opened...
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., It's not going to work.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator," ...humiliating him in front of his bride... uh, her..."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Ann, He's not coming back.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, ...and all of Christendom.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," Destroying Tony Wonder is your sense of purpose? I thought you said, thanks to me."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Because he's performing at a gay club tonight, and I need you to act as my boyfriend to help me get in."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," I'm gonna say no, thank you. And don't you think it's a little inappropriate? I am your brother."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., You sound like my son.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator," Whom G.O.B. had spoken to earlier that day. Ann, her name's Ann, by the way."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Steve Holt," Hey, you remembered."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., (chuckles) How about you and I go to a magic show together?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Steve Holt," I love magic! Of course. I mean, my dad's a magician. Huh, well, you're my dad, I mean, s-so you should know."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Right. Well, it'd be sort of a, a father-son thing. At a gay club. Well, technically gay night at a magic club. Hey, you know what'd be funny? If you pretended to be my boyfriend so I could lock this guy Tony Wonder in..."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Steve Holt," You know, I, I don't know, I don't think this whole thing is sounding like a good idea. Besides, last time we tried to do something together, you didn't even show up."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.,"  You know what? You're mad at me. I get it, I totally get it. And guess what? I'm mad at you."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Steve Holt," You know, Dad, that attitude might be why you're alone all the time. The way you treat people..."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," What about you? I didn't hear from you for your entire childhood, and then thanks for the birthday card that I never got from you for the last 40 years."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, This was extra hard for Steve to hear on his actual birthday.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, And didn't you already try locking Tony Wonder in his trick?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Oh, yeah, but that wasn't for revenge, that was just on spec."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Mort Meyers, (in flashback) Just like Tony Wonder!
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," And it didn't work. Besides, that's before I knew that he had locked me in my trick."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, You still don't know that he tried to lock you in your trick.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Hey, I do know, I have proof. I went in that cave and I found this. (holds up cross pendant) We both know what that stands for."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, Jesus.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," No, that would be a ""J."" This is a ""T."" Tony Wonder was there in the cave the night that I did my big illusion. So when I went yesterday to the cave and I saw that this had wedged my compartment door shut, I knew that I'd been wronged."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, Okay. The only thing that we know is that you tried to lock Tony Wonder in his trick first. Right? So you're even.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," No, no. Because mine didn't work. He got the last laugh, which, in this case, happened to be the first laugh. I don't understand why you can't seem to follow me on any of this."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," G.O.B., you've got a chance to build a brand-new life. Don't run away from it again. Don't try to escape it."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," I don't do that, Michael. Listen, if you insist on speaking to me like you're my wife, then don't be surprised to find my (BLEEP) in you and then you never hear from me again."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," I'm offering you a good job. Selling good homes, making real good money, and I'm not asking for anything in return. (holds out contract and pen)"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., What is this?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," I'm asking for a little something in return. These are, this is for the movie. This is for your life rights in perpetuity, in the known universe and beyond."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Blah, blah, blah, look at this."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," What's that mean, you're not gonna sign it?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," No, I was just thinking that I should have my attorney Bob Loblaw look at this."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," Oh, he doesn't need to..."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Yeah, no, I'm fine with it."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, It's all pretty boilerplate stuff.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., I'm gonna be in a movie.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," No, you're not."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., (chuckling) Okay.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, G.O.B. was making good on a promise he had made to Michael...
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael," (on phone) Hi, Uncle G.O.B."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., I need to see you tonight.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator,  ...to talk to his son.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., It's about your father and you.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael," Really, is... is he upset?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., Do I seem like a clown to you?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael, I got it.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., (to sales clerk) Do I seem like some kind of a clown to you?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael," Look, I got it, I got it, Uncle G.O.B. Just tell me where."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., Meet me tonight at the Gothic Castle.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael, I will. The Gothic Castle?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," No, the Gothic Asshole. Yes, the Gothic Castle!"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael," No, I didn't say the Gothic Asshole."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Wh- what do you think, they call it the Gothic Asshole?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael," No, I said the Gothic Castle."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.,  It's the Gothic Castle.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael, Gothic Castle. Okay.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Sales Clerk, I think you look amazing.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., I'll take it.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Sales Clerk, Great.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," No, no. The compliment, not the shirt."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator," And so it was a very worried George Michael that arrived to speak to his uncle at the Gothic Castle, which, that night, did actually kind of resemble the Gothic Asshole."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael, Uncle G.O.B.!
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Don't call me Unc... Actually, no, that's good, that works here."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael, Is my dad upset? What's going on?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," No, he's fine."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael, But you told me he... was really upset about something.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," I don't know. I do know that your daddy wants you to get your hot little, tight little hot ass right up there right away to see him."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Bouncer, You're good.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael," What, you, you had me come all the way here just to tell me my dad wants me to meet him?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," No, no, no, those two things are unrelated. No, I'm, I'm here 'cause I'm trying to lock this guy Tony into this gay magic trick, and I just need a believable arm candy bean. And don't make that face, you look homophobic."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael," No, I'm not being homophobic. No-"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., Why are you doing this?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael," I, I'm uncomfortable."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., This is very important for me.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael, I'm uncomfortable.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Don't worry, you're blending in here perfectly."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Photographer, A newbie!
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Except, even if he does post that somewhere, the Fakeblock thing'll scrub it away."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael," You know about Fakeblock? You know, that's my software. I wonder if my dad thinks I'm blowing him off because that's starting to take off now."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Well, you should go find out, 'cause I do know that your dad is really, really, really upset with you."

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael, It's my stamp.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Oh, I'm so sorry about that."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael," No, that's okay. I probably won't come back in. I'm, I'm gonna go see my dad."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Yeah, you are 'cause you're a good son. (kisses him then immediately breaks away) Ow! Bit my tongue, that little bitch."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator," Oh, no, he didn't."

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator," I mean, oh, no, he didn't."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Thank you, George Michael; honestly I owe you big-time. Not a lot of nephews would do this for their uncles. (loudly) Now get out of here. I never want to sleep with you again. I mean, I probably will. (whispering) I don't. But are we good? We're good."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator," After successfully looking like he'd had a fight with his boyfriend, G.O.B. put his plan into action. Knowing that Tony would go into the closet and pop out of somewhere else, G.O.B. proceeded to lock everything he could find."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., (locking dumbwaiter) Who's the dumb waiter now?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And that's when he saw something that took him back to a moment when his life had reached its nadir.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Distorted Male Voice," You know, if tomorrow you won't open up and let someone else in..."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Distorted Male Voice, ...then the treasures you have inside may never come out.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, (recording) A magician has many secrets... but there was one I was forced to keep... by society.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And G.O.B. settled in to watch his revenge play out.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," (recording) ""Don't talk to us,"" they said. ""Keep your hands to yourself,"" they also said."

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, I'm in a chair! Did somebody say Wonder?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator," Nobody actually did that time, but I think he got away with it."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, (to G.O.B.) Didn't expect to see you here. Want to get a drink later?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator," And believe it or not, it was this trick..."

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, ...that really brought the crowd to their feet. Although it was pretty easy to figure out how he did it. They started out gay.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, You missed your cue!
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, G.O.B. was having a drink with a man he'd twice tried to sabotage.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., Beanbag chair. I was wondering what you were gonna pop out of.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, Did somebody say Wonder... ing? I always try to stay one step ahead of the audience.Vamanos!
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," Oh, hey, come on, man. Timing, right? Hey, leave the mask."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Yeah, of course, mask. Yeah, that makes sense. I use a mask myself, in my act. But you have to tell me how you do that beanbag trick."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," Well, I guess, since you're a magician, too. But not a word of this. (whispering) I did use a mask. I put it on another guy, and then I was in the beanbag chair the whole time."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Oh, well, that's... that's... (whispering) that's why they put that sign on the beanbag chair that says, ""Do not steal this,"" 'cause you were..."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And the magicians shared the secrets of their ancient and mystical craft.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," (whispering) And also it's very hard to get out of at the end, (normal voice) when I appear. So how have you been? I haven't seen you since your ""wedding,"" when you did the Jesus gag. See, it's like a quotation mark, but with a ""W."""
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Oh, yeah, right, I got ya. That's... I should do that."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," Hey, don't. Okay?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Uh, I, I won't. Yeah, uh, no, the marriage was unsuccessful. I... guess you could say I was a runaway... groom."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," Well, makes sense now, doesn't it?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., What do you mean?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," Well, I mean, you are gay, right?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Oh, yes, right, yeah. Very. Because of what I'm dressed- and my boyfriend was here earlier. And, and he bit my tongue."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And that's when G.O.B. did a magic trick of his own.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., (biting his tongue) Want to see?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," No, I believe you. I'm just surprised, though, because you are the Christian magician. Although you did look awfully shredded on that cross."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., You should have seen me when they took me out of the storage locker.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, Hmm.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.,  But how'd I get in the storage locker?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," That's okay. I know it didn't work. Made the Woops column in Poof. It's cool, though, man; I've been there. Your assistant probably sabotaged you. I don't even use one anymore. I resorted to using my own legs in the ""Saw the Lady in Half"" gag. I even shaved them. Want to feel?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Wow, they are smooth. Like a lady's. I think."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," You're funny. Too bad we can't do this more. But, I don't know if it'd be great for my reputation to be seen with the fundamentalist Christian magician."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And he was suspicious that G.O.B. might not actually be gay.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Valet," Valet is closing. The Cabriolet, license plate ""ANUS TART."""
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., That's me.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," Aw, what the hell? Let's do it."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And that's when G.O.B. came up with a new revenge plan.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Yeah, let's risk it. Right? Let's risk it!"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, Come on.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator," The next day, G.O.B. shared his new plan with Tobias."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tobias, She's just so much fun to be with.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Good. Seems like you're done talking. I, too, am in a relationship, but mine is purely a revenge-based deal. I plan on making this person fall in love with me and then destroying them by breaking their heart."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tobias," How do you make someone fall in love with you? Can you pass the mustard, please?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Yeah. Oh, it's easy when you've got so much in common. (excited babbling) Last night, for instance, we both got a case of the munchies, and then we went out and we stole these pies..."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator," As it turns out, they did a lot more than steal pies. They had a raucous good time."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," And then, the candy bean dish right here, we made those at ""Color Me Mine,"" and I know they're kind of cockeyed, but they remind us both of my crooked smile."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tobias, Sounds like you're really into this girl.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Don't call me girl, friend. No, this is purely an act of revenge, filled with white-hot hate. I'd tell you on who, but this person is sort of a celebrity."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tobias," Oh! Well, turns out my femme fatale is a bit of a celebrity herself."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And that's when G.O.B. found a solution to filling one of the houses.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., ...libraries or Internet or playgrounds within 20 miles of here.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tobias," You know, it's funny, I've been looking for a place to live."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., That's great. When can you move in? 
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tobias," Uh, duh. Now. Oh, the other sex offenders are gonna be so jealous."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., Wait a minute... You know of other people with similar needs?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And that's when he filled the rest.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tobias," Oh, I have a list of men that could fill every opening you have."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Let me get a shot of mustard. That was all cheese, but no mustard."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator," Not wanting to appear desperate, G.O.B. waited till late afternoon to continue his plan to make Tony fall in love with him."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," (on phone) It's Tony. I'm not here right now, because I'm right behind you. Made you look. But how did I know you looked? Because I'm right behind you! Made you look again."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Tony, it's G.O.B. Man, does anybody ever fall... for that? Listen, uh, I was just, I was thinking about you - what a fun night we had the other night. So just call me when you get a chance. Okay? All right."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Well, that was fast, you hot little-"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Lucille, It's your mother.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Hi. Sorry, I, I thought you were somebody else. I can't tell you who, 'cause I'm, I'm dating... someone... famous."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And that's when G.O.B. was given a new job.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Lucille," You better start to build this wall, pronto. I tried with your father, but he can't do it."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And that's when G.O.B. was told to make it look like major construction had begun on the wall.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Lucille, You need to make it look like major construction has begun on the wall.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, So G.O.B. set out to find a crew.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., (through bullhorn) Who wants to... (feedback) Aah! Hurt my ears.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., (using bullhorn through the sunroof) Who wants to help me build a wall...
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Man, Me!
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., ...to keep Mexicans out of America?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Man, (BLEEP)
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.,"  All right, all right! Who wants to help me build a wall for no reason? It's a different wall! (BLEEP) (BLEEP)"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., Aah! This thing is loud!
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And so he decided to head to the border ribbon to put in some manual labor himself.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., ...show everyone that I'm not afraid of the sweet sting of sweat in my... eyes.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, when he came across a local maca picker.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,China Garden, Aw. You need help to make your sign stand up?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., Yes. No! I need to find some Mexicans to help build this wall.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,China Garden," Hey, you know what? You should get the Chinese to build your wall. We make great walls."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., That would be great. How can we make that happen?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,China Garden, I'm Chinese; I know all Chinese. I hook you up.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Well, that's, that's... That'd be... (phone starts ringing) great."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Would you get off my (BLEEP), Mother!"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," (on phone) Well, if I wasn't sure you were gay, I am now."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," It's Tony! Hey, Tony."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder,00?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., Great.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, I'm thinking Little Ballroom. Little Ballroom good? Or you sick of Little Ballroom?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., I'll see you there.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, Bye.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., That was Tony. My friend Tony.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,China Garden," Oh, she sounds wonderful."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," No. No, I'm... gonna get revenge on him and, and destroy his life. Her life. Our... life. Destroy our life. (shrugging) Destroy our life! That doesn't matter. Who cares?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator," But Tony Wonder had a secret, too."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, We're on.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Sally Sitwell," And he definitely thinks you're gay, right?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," Don't worry, the only thing I'm better at than (BLEEP) women is pretending I'm gay. Trust me, I am all man. Give me a little leg shave?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Sally Sitwell," All right, well, you have to be careful. If G.O.B. finds out you're straight, he'll use it to ruin you. And I'll lose the hundred grand I stole from Lucille Austero to re-brand you as the gay magician."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, It seemed Sally Sitwell had a secret also.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, I know that. Why are you telling me all this?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Sally Sitwell," 'Cause if she finds out, we both go down. And I don't want to have to sell that closet as a sweat sauna on Craigslist."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, Ow!
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Sally Sitwell, Ooh. Sorry.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," It's fine. And as long as we're recapping things that we already know, an inside source tells me he's my ticket to Internet billions."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Sally Sitwell, Inside source?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," Oh, I didn't tell you that?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Sally Sitwell, No.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," That's new? It's ""in the bag."""
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, Tony made that sound a lot cooler than it was.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., That Fakeblock thing will scrub it away.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,George Michael," You know about Fakeblock? You know, that's my software. I wonder if my dad thinks..."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator," It took a lot of restraint for Tony to not pop out when he heard the word ""wonder,"" but he was carried into the audience before he could hear that G.O.B. wasn't actually gay."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," Oh, hey, hey. Put a note on me. And in Spanish, too. I don't want some Spanish guy sitting on me."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," Once I get him alone, I get into his phone, get his boyfriend's information. Hack into his software and make a fortune. Ow! How do you not know how to shave a leg?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Sally Sitwell, I've never done it before.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," Anyway, he's halfway to falling in love with me already. I mean, he actually sounded excited about seeing me tonight. Poor guy doesn't realize I'm about to destroy our life."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Sally Sitwell, Our life?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," I mean, destroy our life with G.O.B. Dest... I'm going to destroy our life... my life...  with G.O.B. Destroy my life with G.O.B."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, (shrugging) Destroy my life with G.O.B.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Sally Sitwell, Just be careful. Could be a house of cards.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, Aah! Ooh! Ah!
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Sally Sitwell, Oh!
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, Caterpillar!
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Sally Sitwell, Yep! There it went. That's exactly what that was. Wow!
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, Weird.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Sally Sitwell, Very weird.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, Caterpillar... and that... weird... fuzzy moth in the drain...
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, It seemed Sally had two secrets.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator," And days later, G.O.B. was feeling pretty good.  China Garden had come through with a crew to build the wall, and with the help of a well-placed ad, he'd successfully filled all the homes in Sudden Valley. And he was on his way to a hot date with Tony Wonder."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," (to phone) Siri, where is the Little Ballroom?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Siri, I have three matches.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., I'm going to need the gayest.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Siri," Did you say ""the grayest""?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," (laughs) I need the, uh, gayest one."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Siri," Did you say ""the grayest""?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., I need the gayest Little Ballroom!
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Siri," Okay, ""Gob."" Try this one."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., I've got to tell Michael that I saw another map car. He's gonna be blown away. You don't see them a lot.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, Well...
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Gene Parmesan, I'm fine...
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," Looks like he's turning into a parking lot. My Little Ballroom. Of course, yeah. She's got a kid, he's acting like he's Father of the Year or something. I bet he's pretending Steve Holt is, like, nine. I just saw him, he looks 50."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, But of course G.O.B. was at the wrong Little Ballroom.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., I do not get this lifestyle.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, G.O.B.?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., You're mistaken.

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., Michael.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, Yeah.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Well, look who's here. You."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, Where is she?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," First of all, that's very dated of you, Michael. ""He's"" don't like to be called ""she's"" and I don't who this he-man is that you're referring to."

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., Never met him.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," It's a she. Nice try. Now what are you doing here? You gonna meet her here with her son, maybe, so her son can play in the ball pit?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," That's disgusting, Michael. This is no place for a child."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, I know what you do. Mom told me you were bragging about seeing somebody in showbiz. Then I see a frozen dove in a freezer.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., That could be anything.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," It said ""Love each other"" on the foot band."

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," Rebel. Rebel Alley's. Nice try, G.O.B. If I want to see bad acting, I'll go see Tobias in A Jew Comes to Dinner."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, But G.O.B. wasn't acting. He'd just forgotten that he had met a still-partying Rebel Alley.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Rebel Alley, It's a little dove. He's so cute.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And Rebel returned home to an unfortunate surprise.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator," She felt bad, so quickly put it in a bag, wrote down the species and location from which she'd acquired it, and then one further caution.

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Boy, Thanks for ruining my birthday party. (hits Michael in the eye)
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator," After fighting with G.O.B., Michael paid a return visit to his mother."

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Lucille, Is that from G.O.B.? Was I right about him?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," No, actually. Want to hear a funny story? You're out of the movie."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Lucille," (into phone) Hold on, George. (to Michael) I beg your pardon?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," Did you say George? Is that Dad? 'Cause he's the one who told me to hire G.O.B.

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, Although he quickly lost sight of that plan.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., You're mad at me.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, You stood me up.

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., You think that I care that you're... three years older than me? No! I don't... Check my phone. Check my phone.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, I don't need to check your phone. Come on in.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, But getting G.O.B.'s boyfriend's contact information out of that phone was the reason for Tony's charade.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., He hates me. The whole family hates me.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, Damn it!
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, Which he remembered too late.

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., I can't go home. He's probably waiting for me. He's gonna be my boss? He's the younger brother.

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Ann," Don't worry. It's not you. It was a real magician.

Look, in the act of having fake gay sex, you're going to take off the mask to reveal that you're having real straight sex, destroying his career, and it's all going to be captured on that camera right there!"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Ann, I don't want to have sex with Tony.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., Aren't you just a little cur...?

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Okay, yes, new plan. I'm going to wear this Tony Wonder mask, you're going to wear the G.O.B. mask, and... I am going to have sex with you. I'm sorry about all that. And then, again, you're going to rip off the G.O.B. mask, and the world will think that he's straight, and it'll ruin his career. That's great. Much simpler plan, thank you. But the main event is us having this... pretend gay but actually straight sex. And you know what it is? It's a straight bait. I just realized, it's a straight bait. You ever watch those?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," Good, and let me have the room, yeah. I need a little while to get... same. To be the same."

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, Hey... you.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Ann, It's Ann. Awfully funny time to run into you.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," Yes, it is an... awfully funny time to see you, too... You. I know I owe you child support. Don't worry, I got something big in the works. Actually, that's why I came here. What are you doing here?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Ann, G.O.B. invited me. He's planning on getting revenge on you.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., He would never do that.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Ann, Then why did he want to have sex with me with this on?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B., Wait a minute. Sex with you? G.O.B. is straight?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Ann," Oh, yeah. He is. Tony?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," I just, I... Why would he do that? I thought he was gay."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Ann," Tony, you're not gay, either."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, That's business. Why do you think David Geffen pretends to be gay? You think the Shubert Organization would entrust a project like Dreamgirls to a straight producer?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Ann, How do you know so much about Dreamgirls?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," 'Cause it's my business to know about Dreamgirls. And if you wanted to be in a film version of a musical called The Magic Show, done in 1974 by another secretly straight guy named Doug Henning, you'd make it your business, too. I mean, they can't give everything to Doogie Howser, right? Biggest fake gay there is... by the way. But if I fund it, then they can't say no to me. But it's big money, I mean, 20, 30, 40 mil. Fakeblock money. I can't believe I'm telling you all this. I... I've been overexplaining the (BLEEP) out of everything lately. You can't tell a soul."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Ann," No one I know will care. Look, do you want to out G.O.B. as gay so it'll ruin his career as the Christian magician?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," Yes, of course."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Ann, Are you still your own legs? And do you have toenail polish on you right now?
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," Are you asking, am I wearing any, or do I have any extra? Because the answer to both questions is yes."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Ann," Then we're covered. You and I will have sex. and you wear this G.O.B. mask, and I'll wear a Tony Wonder mask."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder," Okay, I have two questions. One, Are you going to move this time? And two, why can't I just be me and you wear the G.O.B. mask?"
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Ann," I just thought that if you had to have sex with a man, wouldn't it be more of a turn-on to have sex with someone that looks like you? Okay. Put these on, and then meet me in the bedroom in five minutes for some serious secular intercourse."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Tony Wonder, With myself.

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And that's how Ann not only performed a real-life version of Tony's most beloved illusion...

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And relished the opportunity to rub it in. 
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael," Besides, you could not make me feel worse right now."
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," I'd be willing to let you have your apology back if you give me the chance to try. Bad example. If you were ashamed of being in love with a man, suddenly discovered these new feelings, something that you only allowed to happen because you thought he was gay and you were hoping to exact revenge, but then you found out he was straight, then you wanted to get even, so maybe you put a mask on someone and then tried to convince yourself that the sex you were about to have was with yourself, but it turned out to be him, and all you ended up doing was proving that your feelings were real... then I might say something like, ""Homo much?"""
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Michael, It's not that.
4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,G.O.B.," I said, ""Bad example."""

4,A New Attitude,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_A_New_Attitude,Narrator, And G.O.B. decided to be generous with his last Forget-Me-Now...

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Shh! I'm trying to get my parents to notice me. I've been here for like an hour and a half.

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," And Maeby didn't because, and I never told you this, but George Michael wasn't a very good kisser. It seems he both used his tongue to fend off the intruding tongue, but also laterally moved his lower jaw while constricting his lower lip. The upper lip, meanwhile, tended to retract, revealing an exposed area from the front teeth to the canines, ultimately creating more pain than pleasure. Really just rookie mistakes, but all of it conspired to make Maeby concerned about him wanting to get more serious."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," No, less serious."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, What?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," Well, my dad doesn't think that it's such a good idea for you and me to be together."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, And that... doesn't make me hotter to you?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," No, I could see that argument. I, I- no, I think we should just be cousins."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," So first my parents don't notice that I drowned, and now my cousin doesn't care that I'm at the height of my sexuality."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," Oh, sure I care, and, y-you know, I'm right there... with you. We're a couple of... forces of nature, but..."

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," Forces of nature. But I just really need to focus on graduating right now, and... maybe you should too, you know? Maybe that's the best way to get your parents' attention."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, That's a great idea. I've got two whole months to flunk. That's got to disappoint them!
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, Maeby was trying to get her parents to notice she was flunking.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," So, for some reason, they didn't send me a cap and gown, and I was gonna make one out of sheets, but I couldn't find-"

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," No, we do not need that many extras."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, ...where she'd be working at what was once just her after-school job.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lynda," Well, it might be worse to insist on using less because you've got to pay them for a shot."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Right. Okay, do we have to pay them in money or in rice?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lynda," If they're in the union, you have to pay with rice."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, This movie is...
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," The movie she was supervising was the latest in her terrifying grandmother Gangie franchise, this one taking place in India."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," All right, I say we get 10,000 extras, and then... "
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lynda, That way we have it.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Yeah, we have it."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lynda,It's good to have it.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Tobias, I am going to start wearing this back home.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," You'd think someone would tell her to shave her arms, the poor thing."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," And soon, she and her team arrived and headed off to the hotel."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Wait, how is it pronounced? Ganges. Gangie on the Ganges? That doesn't even make sense."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, Where she found out why her mother wasn't at the graduation that Maeby also wasn't not at.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay, You don't get it. I'm not used to third world hotels.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Male Concierge," No, you don't get it. You are so full of (BLEEP)."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Female Concierge, Raj? That is the greatest insult you can say to a person.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, You have got to be kidding me. Do we have a hair and make-up crew with us?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lynda, Pretty make-up or scary make-up?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Scary.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lynda," Well, I think we have the crew that did The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Perfect.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, And that's how Lindsay ended up receiving this spiritual advice.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,  I'm just so full of passion. 
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby as Shaman Sheman,  You are so full of (BLEEP). 
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,"  Yeah, yeah."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby as Shaman Sheman,  Pull your head out of the sand. Love is where you left it. 
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,  The only person back home is Tobias. 
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby as Shaman Sheman,  You have no children? 
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,"  No. Why do you ask? Well, yes. A daughter. She's away at boarding school in England."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby as Shaman Sheman,  Is that where we left it?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, Although you'd think this would have given her away.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,  Hug?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby as Shaman Sheman,  Please don't squeeze the shaman.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, And while it did bring the family back together...
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Michael," ...on the stimulus money, too, right? Stop with the prayer hands. It just looks like you're out of ideas. "
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,  Says the least spiritual man I know. 
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, ...it did make it harder for Maeby to make this insult stick.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Don't you think it makes you... seem a little, um, what is that saying? Full of (BLEEP)."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,"  Thank you, Maeby. That's actually a compliment in India."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, My own fault.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,"  I'm here because a shaman told me that love is where I left it. Which, after much soul searching and by process of elimination, is Tobias."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Tobias, I got the part.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," But soon, the Fünkes took their new spirit of love and togetherness into a place where they would seldom run into each other."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Okay! Going back to school! Senior year!
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, And Maeby enrolled in a new high school for her senior year...
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, No? No one cares? This is usually a tough time for teens! This is when drugs often become an issue!
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, ...to see if her parents would notice she should have already graduated.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Time for Babies Having Babies!
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Tobias, Is Babies Having Babies on? That's my favorite show.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay, (reading) Mother's Day Eve was the most joyous day of the year. Maeby! You're going to be late for school.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, And although they did share one Thanksgiving together...
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Tobias, It's not on.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, ...they didn't realize they were doing so...
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,  Why would they preempt Babies Having Babies for a turkey cartoon?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," ...having celebrated it one week earlier, when they found that duck in the cupboard, tried to cook it alive..."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Tobias, Duck l'orange! 
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," ... got scared, and then ended up eating it at a Chinese restaurant."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Woman," Okay, yeah, we cook the duck for you."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," Nonetheless, Maeby was doing well in school, and might have graduated had this not happened."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay," (on machine) Look, I'm sorry, Tobias, but we're trying to save something that just couldn't be saved. Can you delete this so I can leave a message for Maeby?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Tobias," (on machine) Lindsay! I have... met someone. It's not important who it is... Erase this message, and I'll leave her a message."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay," (on machine) Maeby, honey, Daddy has insisted on raising you alone."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, But at least her father was choked up.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Tobias," Maeby, your daddy's not going to be around anymore. (clears throat) Excuse me, I swallowed a bug there. Uh, your daddy's not going to be around anymore..."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Widow Carr," (on machine) This is the Widow Carr, and for some reason it's my job to that since you never made payment, your house is being foreclosed. Also, Tobias, you got a callback for something called The Big Bang Theory."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," Having lost her parents and her house, Maeby stopped bothering with high school, skipped her grandmother's trial, and headed to LA. She now had to make sure that she had an income."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Kitty, Guess what?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, What?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Kitty, I'll just tell you.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Yeah.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Kitty," 'Cause I feel like we'll be here forever, and I have a meeting. Um, you're fired."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Why?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Kitty," Well, because you don't have a high school diploma and we have a very strict policy here that everyone has to have a high school diploma on account of the fact that (whispering) Ron never graduated."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Is this really happening?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Kitty," Actually, I was thinking I wasn't even gonna have to fire you 'cause it's been on Deadline all day."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, How did they even find out?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Kitty, Does it even matter anymore?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Yeah, it does."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Kitty, I told them.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," With no parents, no job, and no place to leave, Maeby had squat, which is exactly what she decided to do at her grandparents' penthouse. And that's when Maeby did what we in the entertainment industry call ""deadlining."""
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, (flopping down) Come on.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,  What do you think?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," On the plus side, each parent thought she was with the other."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,"  We're not moving in, we're... occupying a space with central air. "
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, So Maeby was as free as that bird.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, (seeing ostrich) (BLEEP)!
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Marky Bark," Cindy? You okay? All right, this will be where she goes. "
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," So she retreated to the long-abandoned model home, where she discovered it's a lot harder to get out of a Bluth home than into one."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Pieces of (BLEEP).
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," And maybe it was because she had never fully disappointed her parents, and they were getting older - or perhaps it was because there was no Internet at the model home..."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, That is it. This is like living in 1999.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," ...but that's when Maeby became a high school senior for the third time, and then a fourth. And then it just sort of became what she did. And it ultimately led to this."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," So, I'm still gonna stay in high school until they notice me. You know, just like, let them think, ""Oh, no, should we be worried? Is she really that immature?"""
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," Yeah. Well, I mean, isn't it, uh... kind of a little immature to try and make your parents worry like that?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Oh, that's good, I'm gonna try and work that in there."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," No, I think it's in there. Yeah, well, let's get you in here before our third roommate shows up. That's Paul Huan."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,P-Hound, Hi.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, So there's three people who live in here?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," Yeah, well, one guy is just kind of crashing here."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Well, it can't be worse than living with your dad."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," It's not. No, it's not worse than that."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, And later she was joined by her uncle.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Michael," Excuse me. Hello. (hugs Maeby) Didn't say it was your cousin. Now, that's smart. Let him think there's a girl in here."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Yeah, we were just complaining about roommates."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Michael, P-Hound.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, I thought it was the other one.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," No, it was, it was P-Hound, yeah."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Michael," Yes, he's the worst. See, I think if George Michael and I didn't have each other as roommates, we'd be going crazy."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," And for a moment, Maeby felt superior to her cousin. And her uncle, for that matter."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Michael," Actually, have you told her about your software?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, No. Software?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Michael," He's got this privacy software. Keeps people from stealing your stuff. Tell her, pal."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, Maeby tried to hide her jealousy.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, So it's privacy software that's also anti-piracy? Do you have a way of doing this?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," Well, it's just a Boolean... driven aggregation, really, of what programmers call ""hacker-traps""... "
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," But as she listened to her cousin discuss computer technology that she had no understanding of, she lost that feeling of superiority, and her self-esteem plummeted as she started to question the entirety of what she had done with her life for the last several years. "
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," ...which uses false meta-data on top of false rate authentication and a fake profile that would misdirect, completely copy those users away from anyone's personal information and... so, you know, in other words, when you have friends over, you know, you're listening to music and they want to steal your music and copy your movies, or, or just look at your photos. You know, this prevents that. It just neutralizes that so it's not even a threat. It's called Fakeblock."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Michael, Great name.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," Yeah, well, you know, it's super low-hanging fruit. Someone's gonna do it. We're just trying to be those guys, you know."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Michael," I don't understand a word of it, but, it, it, it works. You should see his Facebook page. Doesn't have a friend on it."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," Of course, that last part had nothing to do with Fakeblock."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," Thank you, Dad."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, But it did help George Michael's self-esteem.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, Maeby was feeling discouraged as she got back on the bus for high school.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Girl #1," Hey, do you wanna get high with us behind the gym?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Girl #2," Wait, we don't know her. I hear there's an undercover cop at school."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Girl #1, Can you imagine what kind of loser pretends to be in high school when they're in their 20s?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Well, it's pretty gutsy, right? I mean, it's better to take the risk, right?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Girl #1," Yeah, maybe you're right."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Girl #2," Yeah, maybe you're right."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Both, Cop.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Perfecto Telles," Hey. How was your tutor? He's not going to take you away from me, is he?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Well, not until his software hits and he can buy me an apartment. I'm living in a (BLEEP)hole."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Perfecto Telles, I hear they're hiring at Chipotle.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, And that's when Maeby realized maybe she should have graduated high school.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Can I get a Macallan 12 neat, water back?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Bartender, ID?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Actually, can we make it, uh, oh, marry me, a Wild Turkey?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Bartender, I still need to see some ID.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Right. There you go.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Bartender, I'm supposed to believe you're 17?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Oh, no, sorry, that's my fake for sneaking back into high school. Here we go. 23."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Bartender," Oh, you're Maeby. Well, you can have one, but you got quite a bar tab."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," I've got to graduate. I mean, I got to start bringing some cash in, you know?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Bartender, Yeah.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Everyone's just passing me by. George Michael. Kitty Sanchez.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Officer Carter, Drinks for the house.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, This guy.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Bartender, These guys are making a fortune off that To Entrap a Local Predator show they're on.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Officer Taylor, Were. They won't let us shoot in Laguna.

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, What are you doing here?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Barry," Well, I could ask you the same thing."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, I go to high school here.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Barry, I could answer the same thing. I was just looking for something more believable.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Speaking of believable, I was going to ask you a question about that. Um, can somebody get kicked out of high school if they're too old? I think I was made at a bar."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Barry," Ha! I know this part of the law very, very well. After 21, it is illegal for you to enroll in high school in the state of California. As a matter of fact, you cannot even lurk! ""Lurk."" What, do they got cameras in the bushes? Why would they do that? You can't even see into the locker rooms from there."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Okay, so, what do I do? Because the guy who caught me goes to school with me."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Barry," Oh, well, that's easy. You get something incriminating on him. Call me in the office, we'll discuss it. And then I can also keep a record, you know, for billing and so forth."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Yeah, well, maybe I'll just keep a record of it, too, so I can follow up with my own bill. (raises phone to photograph Barry)"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Barry," Oh-ho-ho, very good. You should be the lawyer. Very good. Pro bono."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," Knowing that she could very well be kicked out of school, Maeby went in search of an overdue check at the penthouse. And as she was checking out the mail..."

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, I'm getting an Opie?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, And it did boost her esteem.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Hey.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," The only bigger honor would be having an award like that named after you. I guess. Days later, however, she was called to Donnie Richter's classroom."

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, You know what? I think I will do better once I get a little Mexican in me.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, Maeby got her cousin to drive her to the Opies so she could impress him with her achievements.

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Mort Meyers," No, they only give that award away to somebody after they die, or, even worse, after your career is dead."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Really.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Mort Meyers," Well, consider yourself lucky. They told you your career was over. I didn't find out until I was locked out of my office, 'cause see, I, I passed on Hunger Games. It wasn't the most graceful of exits."

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, You started an Internet company?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Mort Meyers, It's the real deal. It's a system that automates provisioning.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," And once again she found herself with someone who had not only moved on with their life, but done so in ways she couldn't understand."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Mort Meyers, A programmable overlay upscalable multi-tenancy pipeline across multi-user overseas financial transactions. It's called Schnoodle.

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," You know, I can laugh about it. I can laugh because I'm actually on the upswing. I was just telling Mort here that I've actually started my own Internet company. I was just about to tell you."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Mort Meyers," Well, if you need a name, I'm the guy who came up with Schnoodle. How do we know each other?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Rebel Alley, We don't.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Mort Meyers, That's what it is.

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Yes.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael, Thank you. I don't want people to know that I'm doing this.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Everybody has to know about this, okay? This could be big for me. I could make Fakeblock huge."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," No, no, Maeby, there is no company. Fakeblock is just a software that I'm developing. And the whole point is that it's private. So you can't be telling people about it."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," No, we gotta tell people about it. I just got a lifetime achievement award. I'm finished. And also, I think you should consider calling it The Fakeblock. It's cleaner. Like The Netflix."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," Yeah, but it's just not ready. Okay? There's still a bunch of programming... problems."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," You can get it ready, George Michael. What, you think they invite the animals and ask them to wait while they build the zoo?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," No, that would be a bloodbath."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Yeah, a total (BLEEP) bloodbath."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael, We have no money to start a business.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Don't worry. I'll get the ball rolling with some free publicity when I accept my award. Come on, this could be my only chance to be a heiress."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael, A Harris?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," All right, fine. You can still be the boss, okay? I just don't want people to know that I'm working with my cousin. So you are not my cousin. You are not George Michael Bluth."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," No, I'm, I'm great with that. In fact, you know what... might really help us sell it is- Oh, heiress. You mean... You don't pronounce the H. And that's not what heiress means."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, I pronounce the H.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," No, but that's not how the word is sai- You know, we say words the way we say them for a reason."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Rebel Alley, So what is this? Is this another one of those social networking things? Because I am so over those. I tried to deactivate my Facebook profile. It's easier to get out of Scientology.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Well, this is actually the opposite of Facebook. It is the anti-social network. It prevents piracy. Right?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Rebel Alley, Really?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael, Mm-hmm.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Rebel Alley, Rebel Alley.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael, George Mi- Harris.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Rebel Alley," George Maharis, huh?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," And that's how George Michael finally got that new name. It felt like a good fit. Strong, rugged, untainted."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," Yes. Yes, George Maharis."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Perfecto.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael, De nada.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, That's my undercover cop boyfriend. I'm trying to get him in bed.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, And Maeby set to work in trapping him into becoming a predator.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Hey. I know why you're here.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Perfecto Telles, Promise you won't tell anyone at school. I'm just a huge fan of teen stars.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Yeah. That's very convincing.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Perfecto Telles, Yeah.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, You're a better actor than most of the kids here. Even Zack and Cody.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Perfecto Telles, Are they here? I thought they were filming a movie in Maui.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Look, I may only be 17, Perfecto, but I know you're a cop. Yeah, there it is, that cop stare. I got to tell you... I find it very sexy."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Perfecto Telles," Okay. Okay, all right. I'm a cop. I'm working here undercover. We're hunting down an ex-CIA operative named Esteves who's gone rogue, and... It's the kids from Modern Family! Sorry. He's become a drug kingpin and his son goes to Newport.

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Perfecto Telles, You better believe it. Rico!
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," On her way to accept her award, however, figuring she wouldn't be at an event like this again, she stopped for some coconut shrimp.

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,  So... what are you doing here? 
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, I'm getting a lifetime achievement award for my work in the entertainment business. 
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,  I tried. Tell your therapist I tried.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, I'm not in therapy!
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,  Then I must have done something right!
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, And soon she was saying farewell to Hollywood in a way she hoped they'd remember.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Thank you, Kirk Cameron, for that incredibly Bible-y introduction.

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,David,"  Herbert Love would like to see her. You can arrange that? Obviously, discretion is appreciated."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, And that's how Maeby got both the seed money for her company...
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, I'm the discreetiest.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,David,"  Just to be clear, I want to hire her for prostitution."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Yes, no, definitely. That was clear. I'm gonna charge you for that."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, ...and became her mother's pimp.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Herbert Love,  This wall is gonna be good. It'll be good.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," Of course, the plan required getting back into her mother's good graces to trick her into turning a trick."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,"  Hi, sweetie. "

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,  I thought I'd surprise you with a visit.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, And that's how Maeby was able to get her mother to meet Herbert at the club that Maeby still belonged to.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,"  He did give me his card. Oh, I could never call him. "
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, I could call him for you. And I'll tell him... it has to be tonight.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, Technically she still needed to talk her mother into having sex with him.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,"  Well, the sooner the better. "
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, But this was a woman who once wore this to a men's prison...

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," ...so she felt she'd be okay. And soon, she was pimping out George Michael's software company as well."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Fakeblock, it's exploding. I got my PR company fanning it. I even got it to the attention of Jim Cramer."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael, Jim... Cramer?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," He's a guy I've worked with, and he even mentioned it on Mad Money."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Jim Cramer," This Faceblock thing is poised to explode! I never do this- hell, i-it's not even a stock yet. For all I know, it's not even real! But I think this might be going through the roof! I'm calling it my first Hypothetical Buy. And this weekend, don't forget to catch me on Gangie IV. Here's a taste."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Jim Cramer," (on TV) This old lady's crazy! I'm raising the alert level from ""Don't Leave the House"" to ""Board Up Your Windows!"""

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,David,"  Oh, I got it."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, (dropping cash everywhere) Oh!
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,David,"  Oh, I'm sorry."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, I dropped the whore money.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, ...from Herbert Love for services she got her mother to unknowingly render.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Well, why don't you take him out to dinner, hmm? Guys who are used to being charged - I mean, in charge, sometimes like it when the other person takes control."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,"  Hmm. Well, maybe I will."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," How about the Balboa Yacht Club, huh?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,  Of course.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Put it on the family tab. All right, have fun. I wish I could go out to dinner. (prepares to eat parmesan and mustard) What am I doing? This is disgusting. I've got money coming in."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, All the while putting money into the company...
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," ...ultimate privacy on the web until now. If you don't believe me, do a something search on it."

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," (to delivery guy) Right. Um, do you want some... stock options? Yeah? All right, well, split it up with everyone. That's for everybody."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, She even got George Michael a cool retro company car.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Hey.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael, Hi. You actually rented a little office.

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael, I don't know who that is.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, You don't?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael, Never met the woman.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Well, she'll be the one driving the stair car from now on. It was part of the deal."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael, You gave her my car?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Yeah, it's technically hers anyways, 'cause of the Bluth company. But I did get you her 1988 yellow Cadillac."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael, Yeah?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," She only uses it to and from hip replacements. (laughs) Uh, I guess that's only funny... if you know who she is."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," And with the extra cash, even got around to spraying for pests at the model home where she was squatting."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,G.O.B., (over Steve Holt's phone) ...and thanks for the birthday card that I never got from you for the last 40 years. 
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Hey, so, what do I owe you?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Steve Holt, Here you go.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, That's funny. I actually used to date a guy named Steve Holt.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Steve Holt, (laughs) Steve Holt!
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Yeah, that's the guy."

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Steve Holt, Heck of a birthday this is shaping up to be.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator," In fact, it was about to get worse."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, And Maeby's privacy was about to get violated when her uncles barged in unannounced.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Michael," Now, now, I know I've got these things, uh, very, you know, meticulously maintained."

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Michael, There's... there are some vultures. I think they might still smell Pete.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, And she still managed to continue seducing Perfecto into seducing her.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," I'm like, ""This top is completely see-through."" I'll put it on and show you. I'm like, ""Where am I supposed to wear this?"""

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," I know, it's okay, just focus. I'm going to take the cart and show George Michael his new office. Speechless, huh?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Mort Meyers, How do I get back?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Of course, when Fakeblock hits, we're going to have to ramp up real fast. This hangar can hold over 500 nerds!"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," Maeby, we can't afford this. And my software isn't even rea...dy."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Don't worry about that. Just worry about the app being done in time for the big public unveiling at Cinco. I'll get the money.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael, Isn't that like in three days?

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael," Oh, I think we should delay the keynote."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," You know, I'd say yes, but I don't think we can just because of the sheer amount of money that you have on the hook for it. (drives off on cart)"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,George Michael, Maeby? You're fired!

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," Yeah, um, Uncle Michael, I'm, I'm really sorry about that whole voting you out of the dorm thing. You know, we never really meant it to..."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Michael," Ah! I knew it. I knew you didn't understand it. I knew you guys were all... 'Cause I didn't, I don't think I explained it... very well, and it was very, very simple. I made it complicated. It was a four person vote. You see, I voted against myself, so that P-Hound... And that's the way that, that scenario would've worked out. What I later realized that there was another scenario... Maeby? That there was another scenario..."
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, Yeah.

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Michael, What do you mean?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby," I've got to tell you, I think movies are dead. Maybe... it's a TV show."

4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,  It's dirty money anyway. Love gave it to me.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, Maeby felt bad.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, He gave you money directly?
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Lindsay,"  If you can believe that. Anyway, this is your money now, and if you choose to do facial reconstruction... I mean, the nose, right?"
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Narrator, But Maeby was more concerned about losing yet another income stream.
4,Señoritis,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Se%C3%B1oritis,Maeby, So he's trying to snake the bottom bitch from my stable?

4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, ...as George Michael tried to compensate for his lack of income from his father by volunteering for experiments.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Hi. (he's strapped into a chair) So I don't run off?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Sheila, I hope you're not feeling too awkward.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Oh, don't be crazy."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Sheila," Now, when the mouth to mouth test begins, I'm gonna be yelling out letters that indicate mouth movements. What I need you to do is just give me on a scale of 1 to 10, your pleasure level."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Fine.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Sheila," 10 being the most pleasurable, 1 the least. Let's hope we get to 10."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Well, work our way up to it."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Sheila, Bringing in the mouth unit!
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And that's when he realized what the straps were for.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," (jumps) Oh, is that... Okay, I guess so it's not, uh, gonna be a person."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Sheila, And C?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, I think one on C.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Sheila, M? M?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, One on...

4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, One. One.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Sheila, F? F?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, But it wasn't until his year abroad that George Michael got an education in life.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Because after a year of trying not to be an imposing guest in his new country, he was ready for a summer that would end up turning his life upside-down..."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, ...when the woman whose children he was nannying...
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, ...opened him up sexually.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael,00?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rosalita, The drones are coming! Nothing matters now! (starts to kiss him) Why do you kiss like this?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Like what?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rosalita, The teeth! They must not be used like this.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," It was actually a jaw and lip retraction issue, but she had neither a command of the language nor the data that we do."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rosalita, You make love like a boy!
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Spanish, speak to me in Spanish. Because the only way the college credit is actually activated is if I have..."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rosalita, Tómame.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Cook... cook at... cooking at you?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rosalita," Overpower me! Oh, yes. Make me cry."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, You're a terrible mother.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And so it was a very different George Michael that returned to school for senior year.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, Eager to unleash his new overt sexuality on an unsuspecting campus.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," (to freshman whose van is stuck) Hey, man. It gets better."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," And for George Michael, senior year did get better. He was like a king returning to his castle."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, I sort of feel like a king returning to his castle.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, Only to discover that they thought he was two kings.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Dean Fleer, Welcome to your castle.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And they had doubled the size of his castle.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Double castle.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Doug Fleer," Can't wait to meet Michael, George."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, It would be the perfect backdrop to unveil George Michael 2.0.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Todo mío. ...Todo mía? Mío.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, But George Michael's development was about to be forestalled.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Dad!
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael, Pete died.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," God. ...Uh, who's, uh, Pete?"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael, Don't worry about it. Don't you worry about it. I like this. I like the mustache.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Oh. It's kind of fun.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," That's great. Probably gonna want to shave it off by the start of next quarter, otherwise, they're gonna think you're a musician. Huh? But I love it... Dude."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, I'm never gonna be louder than an electric guitar. Maybe using a band to showcase my wood block skill is a dumb idea.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, Too bad there's no such thing as an electric woodblock.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, That sounds like a mother of an invention.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And so they set to work inventing a downloadable app that would allow one to play an electronic version of a woodblock on their smartphone.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," See, that's important. Well, that's what it is. So it's basically like you'll always have a woodblock with you. (laughing) I can't believe nobody's ever done this."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, A quick something search would have shown the guys that there were already three woodblock apps on the market.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound," So, there are three on the market..."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, Which they did.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Es y estamos en ahumada.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," But even after doing that search, they were undeterred."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Download them. Come on, let's do it."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, I hope we're not doing this on my account.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," No, we're doing it so that we can see what the competition is like."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound," No, I mean... on my iTunes account."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, It's 99 cents.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound," Yeah, times three!"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And soon they realized what kind of competition they were up against.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Well, these are a (BLEEP) joke."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, (laughing) I know.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Where are the mallet options? There's no choice of wood weight or grain type. There's no diameter hole option. I mean, what is this, BabyTock?"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, BabyTock?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," You know, the sharp metal box that you put in the crib. Is that not a well-known...?"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, But this is fine.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And they set to work.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," No, I understand that, I get that. But it j- but it just seems like you're leaving a hole just right in the middle of the block. "
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound," Well, it won't be a block on anything 3G. "
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, Although some of the work had to happen outside the room.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," Buddy, is that schoolwork? "
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, Which was challenging. And soon they were close to finishing an app they had decided to call...
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," (into phone) ""Woodblock."" (to P-Hound) It's taken. ""Blockwood."" It's taken."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And that's when he came up with...
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," ""Block of wood""?"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, Which was also taken.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Wow.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, Block-block?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, No. People are gonna think we're in the chicken noise business.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, How is that a chicken noise?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," You know... (standing) Well, it's kind of hard to do in these matador pants, but, you know... Block-bl..."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Man, (on phone) Fakeblock is available. Do you want Fakeblock?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Oh, uh, okay. They have Fakeblock. Okay, yes, we'll take that. No problem. That's no problem. Could you hang onto that for me, please, and I'll call you back? Thank you. I-it's $5000 for the domain name, and then there's this whole XML website fee."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, I got the last one.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, That was 99 cents.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, Times three!
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And George Michael realized he needed to bring in some cash.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Woman, We actually have a variety of subjects that high school students need tutoring in. If you want to just take a look at that list and let me know if there's anything there that you've handled before.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, There was. Although George Michael couldn't imagine it was the same Maeby.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Is this F in ""Maeby F"" her last name or her grade?"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Woman," It's her last name. But her most recent grade is... Well, this just shows an Elvis Presley head."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," So, that bad? I'll take her."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Woman, Stay on top of her. You may need to ride her pretty hard.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," (to mirror) ""Hey, you must be... What?"""
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, This is the girl you broke up with?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," ""Huh? What is this?"" I can't wear this. Yeah, well, we dated for a while, but, you know, I was a kid, and I didn't know how to kiss yet. I don't know, for whatever reason, I listened to my dad who said she wouldn't make it work."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, Was she your first?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Cousin? No. Why would you... Why would your mind go right to th... no. No, it's just he was right. We were kids. I wasn't yet O.S."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator/P-Hound, Overtly sexual.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Right. ""As I live and breathe. Crazy. That's just crazy."""
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Okay, so listen. After I let her in, you go and try and keep my dad out. All right? I can't let him get in the way of this one. (opening door) Hey, you must be..."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, But first he had to cover his tracks.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, What?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, This had to look like fate.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby, George Michael? 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Huh? What is this? Maeby, what are you... doing here? As I live and breathe. I..."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," But for the phrase, ""As I live and breathe,"" he nailed it."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, I thought you were the girl. I'm supposed to tutor a kid from... 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby, High school. Yeah. That's me. 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Crazy. That is just crazy.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," And even though George Michael wanted to seduce her, he couldn't help but challenge her strategy for staying in high school."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," But still, I mean, you have to make a living, right? Don't you need an education?"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," Well, don't forget... I'm a heiress."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, A Harris?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," Yeah. Someone who ""inherits"" a lot of money."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Yeah, well, you know, I wouldn't put all my Anns in that basket."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," You know, it's fine. You don't get it. You've never been a risk taker. I like to (BLEEP) with people. That's what I do. I'm making a statement."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, I love it.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," You know, I knew you were cool when I saw you wearing that shirt."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, Thanks.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, More betrayal.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Oh, no, I get it, too. No, I love... I love it too. You know, I... I love to... love... now."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, George Michael found himself less overtly sexual than he'd hoped.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, I made a 40-year-old woman cry in Spain.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, I love making love to Spanish women.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Get out.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And George Michael slipped back into seduction mode.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," A man, a woman... A bedroom. Let's solve for X."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby, I don't know what you're talking about.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Well, you know, in algebra, that you have an unknown element, and, uh, we call it X, and then you have to solve for it to find out what number X is."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby, X isn't a number.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," So you don't even really know the basic, the basic..."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," But in that moment, the urge to educate her was more powerful than the urge to kiss her."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, (bringing out whiteboard) ...stuff real quick.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," All right, so if you take something like this, 3X + 1 = 10..."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," And with the algebra lesson complete, George Michael pivoted back to his overtly sexual seduction."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," So therefore, when I say, ""You and me in a bedroom, let's solve for X,"" I'm, I'm stating it as a kind of formula."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," Yeah, let's get wasted. Let's... drink that formula."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," (laughing) It's not that kind of formula. No, I'll show you what a formula is real quick, 'cause that's very important. You're gonna wanna..."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, But when the door opened...
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Dad.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, ...George Michael's window of opportunity closed.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael, Bad news. P-Hound is yanking our chain again. 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby, Uncle Michael. 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," Oh, my God."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," And after a brief reunion, George Michael had another opportunity to impress his cousin."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael, Have you told her about your software? 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby, No. Software? 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," He's got this privacy software. Keeps people from stealing your stuff. Tell her, pal. "
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby, So it's privacy software that's also anti-piracy?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," George Michael weighed his options. Maeby had chastised him for not taking risks, and what would be a bigger risk than perpetuating a lie about software just to ignite the passions of a woman? Of course, it would be a lie, and since Maeby wouldn't know it was a lie, he wouldn't appear to be taking a risk. Perhaps the bigger risk was to tell his father he was lying. That he came up with it because he wanted his father to leave so he could enjoy what remained of his senior year. After all, he wondered, wouldn't that be the course of action taken by an overtly sexual man? A man who owns a pair of matador pants? He had not responded now for 41 seconds, according to his unfailing internal clock, and it was time to come clean."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Well, thanks, yeah. It's a, well, it's just a Boolean... driven aggregation, really, of what programmers call ""hacker-traps""... "
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And he found himself suddenly and effortlessly tapping into a long-inbred instinct for lying.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, ...which uses false meta-data on top of false rate authentication and a fake profile...
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, A Bluth taking his first steps in deceit.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," ...that would misdirect, completely copy those users away from anyone's personal information and... so, you know, in other words..."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," But, the more he talked, the more he actually started to like the idea."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," ...when you, when you have friends over, you know, you're listening to music and they want to steal your music and copy your movies, or, or just look at your photos. You know, this prevents that. It just neutralizes that so it's not even a threat anymore. It's called Fakeblock."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael, Great name. Right?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Yeah, well, you know, it's super low-hanging fruit. Someone's gonna do it. We're just trying to be those guys, you know."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," And, impressed with his own invention, he set about making an impossible dream a reality."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, It's a fake profile that leads hackers away from your actual profile. Do you think we can make something like that?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, You mean something that keeps everything on the internet private and protects everyone's digital rights?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Yeah, I mean, think about it. Everyone has something that they want removed from the Internet."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, George Michael certainly did.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And if the new software served no other purpose than removing this...
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rosalita," (subtitled Spanish) ""I ****ed this guy!"""
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, ...it would be worth it.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," I mean, if we could make something like that, it could be bigger than Facebook. I mean, who wouldn't want something like that? You think you can do it?"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, No.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," No, of course not. No. I mean, this is my chance with Maeby, and I can't even get rid of my own father. You know, what if we just did a vote? Just the roommates. We do a quick vote, and it's, ""Ciao, Fathero."""
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, He's gonna know who voted against him.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Not if I get him to vote against himself.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, Why would he do that?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," No, he wouldn't. He w- I, I was just leaning back, so it looked like I... I got this chair again, didn't I? Maybe I just need to be clear, and just say, ""I'm putting up a wall. We need to rework our whole system here."""
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," Sounds like you guys are working on your privacy software, huh? "
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Hey. How'd you find me? 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," Uh, Trang's grandfather. Boy, shoot me if I'm 86, living in my grandson's dorm, huh? "
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," And, long story short, Michael did end up embracing the voting-out-a-roommate idea."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," And it's adiós, brothiero. It cannot fail. "
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby, That was fun.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Did he look betrayed to you?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby, He kind of always looks that way. I'm going to catch the bus.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, Bye!
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Well, uh, okay. Hey, listen, are you gonna come by on Thursday, or...?"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," Um, I don't think so. I have this thing in LA."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Well, can you blow it off? I mean, you know, you might want to get ""graduating high school"" out of the way."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," Well, I'm getting a lifetime achievement award at this gala."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Well, you might want to get that out of the way too, I guess."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby, Yeah.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Hey, you want me to go with you to that or... Yeah, I can pick you up at your place."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," Oh, they're actually shooting a thing at my place."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," As it turns out, they'd end up just clubbing a Thing."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Tobias," Oh! No, I'm not-"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Tobias, Oh!
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,John Beard, (wincing) Damn!
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," You know what? Yeah, that might actually be a good idea. Because I can't bring any of my friends without getting permission slips from their parents."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Well, that's not really a problem for me."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," Yeah, 'cause you just betrayed yours, right? Awesome."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, George Michael and Maeby arrived at a hotel busy with three separate events.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," (pointing and laughing) No, no, no. (to Maeby) Well, it's, it's really nice to be out with you as adults, you know? In Spain they don't even eat dinner until after 11 p.m."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," Wow, Spain really changed you."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Well, you grow up very quickly in Spain... Oh, my God, I know this guy. Hey. Hey, man. Hey."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,David Henrie," Hey, man."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Hey.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,David Henrie, What are you on?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Publicist," Oh, he's nobody."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, God. It's Justin.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Announcer," Can we get all the actors from The Wizards of Waverly Place together for a chat, please?"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, That's David Henrie. He's Justin from Wizards of Waverly Place.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby, Hmm.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, It's on a lot in Spain.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," Well, I'm gonna go mingle with a bunch of 13-year-olds who think they can still play fifth grade. Have fun."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And George Michael set out to re-unleash his overly sexual persona.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," I'll catch up. (spotting but not recognizing Lindsay) Well, gentlemen, start your engines."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Buenas noches, Pequeña Scarlet. I will be needing a room, please."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Scarlet, How many nights?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Two. Sorry, no, just one night. I thought you were saying how many people."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Scarlet, And... how many beds?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Two. Two... No! Uh, one bed. Why give her the option? Keep it real simple. One bed, one night, two people, let's solve for X."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Scarlet, (to coworker) I hate young Hollywood.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," It's called Fakeblock, Mort. It's gonna blow Schnoodle away."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And it was on his way back to Maeby that he heard her say...
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby, It's called Fakeblock!
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," What's this? You're talking, talking about Fakeblock? "
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley, Oh. How does your privacy software work? 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Uh-huh. It's private.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And that's how George Michael not only met Rebel...
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, I don't want people to know that I'm doing this.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, ...but finally found a way to prove to Maeby that he was a risk taker.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Yes. Yes, George Maharis."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," Only to discover, moments later..."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby, Perfecto.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, ...that she was dating an even bigger risk taker.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, De nada. 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby, That's my undercover cop boyfriend. I'm trying to get him in bed. 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Boyf...? So funny that didn't come up in the car.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley, So how does it work?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Huh? How does what work?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley, Your privacy software. How does it protect you from piracy?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, I don't know. Don't worry about it.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley," No, no, no. No! You really piqued my interest."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, I'm sorry.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," And discouraged that he'd lost Maeby, he tried to salvage his night by taking a picture of Gibby from iCarly. As he was doing this, however, this happened."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," The explosion caused an electrical surge, rendering the Schnoodle software inoperable. Which, to those who saw him, seemed like a genius act of cyber sabotage. Which led to this."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley, What happened?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Mort Meyers, It's dead. That geek Maharis destroyed the whole thing. And you know why? Just because he could. Those Internet geniuses... That's what they do. I'm ruined. I'll probably never get to drive the Schnoodle car. We should work together.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley, No.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Mort Meyers, Smart.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," And a few days later, it would lead to this."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,John Beard," (on TV) I'm John Beard. Here's your 15 seconds of news. Fakeblock's mystery man George Maharis may have just found a way to screw a cap on the Internet, and investors are lining up to fill the company's tank with money, even though he himself remains anonymous. That's all the news that's fit to pump. I quit."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," By the time George Michael returned to campus, even his roommate had heard of George Maharis's Fakeblock."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound," This George Maharis guy stole our name, but we have it registered, so we can sell it to him for a fortune."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," No, I am George Maharis! I'm behind the whole thing. I, I wanted to impress Maeby, so I told her that I created this privacy software."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, Why would you do that?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," You know, it's like the time that you told that girl that you were George Takei's son."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound," Well, it's too late. This thing's taking off. They're saying Fakeblock knocked out Schnoodle."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, That was a coincidence. It must have been a power surge.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, We gotta do something. At least get our five grand back.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Well, I put in the five grand. You put in three dollars."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound," Well, you may have put in the most money to Fakeblock, but I put in the first three dollars, so that makes you a hop-on."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," No, you're the hop-on, Paul, and I know exactly who you're trying to hop on to. Maeby."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, Maybe!
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Yeah, well, you know she's dating a cop, right?"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound," Yeah, she likes risk takers like the P-"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby, Hi.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound, ...Hound.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby, (ushering him away) Keep moving. Can you believe this?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," Maeby was excited, but George Michael knew the stakes were too high for him to continue the lie."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," Fakeblock, it's exploding. I got my PR company fanning it. And I even cashed in a favor to get us mentioned on Mad Money. "
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," You know, I think we might just want to slow it down a little bit on the whole Fakeblock thing, 'cause I'm still not 100% finished with it."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," Well, how finished are you with it? 200%? 500%?"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, I also feel like I'm not 100% finished with your math tutoring.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And then Maeby said something that made him change his mind.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, Do we have those books here?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," I trust you, George Michael. I would not get into bed with you on this thing if I didn't trust you."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Oh, I mean, of course you can trust me in bed."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," No, I mean, I trust you not to take advantage of me."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," No, I wouldn't. We would... we would just lie there."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," We'd just lie there? I mean, I'm talking about business."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, So am I. That's why we would just lie there.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Maeby," Okay. 'Cause I was going to say, when you become an Internet billionaire, you could do whatever you want with me in bed. (laughing)"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, It was that. That's what made him change his mind.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, (laughing) I will. I will.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," And if it was so wrong to lie, surely he would receive some sort of sign."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Oh, hey. I should get this."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, But that wasn't it.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Hi, Uncle G.O.B."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,G.O.B., I need to see you tonight.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, That was his uncle G.O.B. wanting to meet him at a gay club to tell him his father was anxious to see him.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,G.O.B., It's about your father and you. 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Really, is... is he upset? "
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,G.O.B., Do I seem like a clown to you? 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, I got it. 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," George Michael was worried, and even more so, when he caught up with his uncle at a magic club."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Photographer, A newbie!
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,G.O.B.," If he does post that somewhere, the Fakeblock thing'll scrub it away, it's fine. "
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," You know about Fakeblock? You know, that's my software. I wonder if my dad thinks I'm blowing him off because that's starting to take off now. "
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,G.O.B.," Well, you should go find out, 'cause I do know that your dad is really, really, really upset with you. "
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, He is upset? I asked you that. That was literally the first thing I asked you. You're giving me these craz... 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,G.O.B., (licking George Michael's hand) Mad? 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," So it was a very shaken George Michael who arrived later at the Ealing Club, as a frustrated Andy Richter was having trouble getting into the club he was a member of."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Andy Richter," What do you mean, I'm already up there? Obviously, I'm not already up there because I'm here. It's my stupid brother. He looks just like me. I'll just go up, I'll find him, I'll st... (guards stop him) Oh, come on."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Oh, hey, Donnie! Hey, I had you for a semester at Openings."

4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Guard, (to George Michael) Go on up. Go up.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Andy Richter," Oh, come on! Oh, some Openings child you are, man."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And George Michael girded himself for his first meeting with his father since he voted him out of the dorm.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," (to bartender) Hi. Yeah, just a Sea Breeze, please. Make it a strong one. Put some stank on that."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley, George? George Maharis?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, And that's when he heard the name he'd forgotten he'd given out as his own. So he tried not to act surprised to hear it when he saw it was Rebel.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, I see you.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," Unfortunately, this meant being stuck affecting a blasé attitude."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley, Rebel Alley? We spoke three days ago.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," I know, I know. I remember."

4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," No, I'm not. No, I just walked in past the big black security guard."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, All of which now worked against him.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley," Okay, you know what? I was just trying to be nice, but you're just a jerk. You're a bigger jerk than Andy Richter over there!"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rocky Richter," Loosen up, bitch. I'm Andy Richter! I probably make, like, $8000 a day or something."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Hey, hey, I'm sorry. Uh, I... You know, I'm in the middle of a whole thing with my dad right now, and I, um, I didn't mean to be... However I just came off."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley, Badly.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Well, I'm sorry, you know. I've never met a beautiful actress before."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley, Oh. So you do know who I am?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Oh, God, of course I know who you are! You were in the remake of Dangerous Cousins. I signed up to Netflix because of that movie. I think I was just thrown that... you were interested in who I am."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley," Well, you are George Maharis. Everyone's talking about your software company. I'm sure women are just throwing themselves at your feet."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Well, you know, I, uh, I prefer a woman who... aims higher."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley, (laughing) That was funny.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Yeah, I know. That was good. That was..."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley, Smooth.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," ...smooth. Hey, we have the same taste in words!"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley," Okay, should we get a drink? I'm buying. I don't want you to think I'm after you for your money."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, George Michael was thrown by what was clearly Rebel's stated interest in him.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Man, George Michael? George Michael?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, Which is perhaps why he ignored the page...
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Man, George Michael? George Michael?
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, ...that he assumed was from his father.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Man, Is George Michael here? 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley,  Is George Michael here? 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Oh, God. Just remind me not to go in the men's room!"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Ex- would you excuse me? I'm, I'm just gonna use the men's room."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rebel Alley, Okay.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," And while checking his messages, he got some good news."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," Hey, buddy, it's Dad. Um, I am having real trouble getting up there. Uh, this traffic is un-believable. We got a light aircraft right in the middle of the freeway. Call me back when you get this?"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," Or, or, you know, you can wait for me up there and..."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," But while Michael was leaving a second message, George Michael left one for him."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," Oh. Hey, hang on, this is you."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Hey, it's me. You know what? We, I bet we're sitting in the exact same traffic. This is a mess."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, Now hoping to ensure that his father didn't make it to their meeting.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," But, you know, we can just do this another time if that works, that, I mean that's a better- Oh, God, they're forcing us off. Oh, God, they're forcing us off. But, you know, we can just do this another time if that works, that, maybe that's better- Oh, they're closing the lanes. Oh, this is beautiful."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael, Same traffic. ...Unreal.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," (over phone) ...Unreal. Kind of looking around for you now. Maybe you're right near me. Anyhow, if you get this, maybe we will just meet... somewhere else. Gonna hang up now. I'm gonna video this and send it in to the news."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," Glad you're getting some footage of this 'cause I can't really get a good angle myself. They're forcing us off here like a bunch of animals. You know, maybe we'll do this another time, 'cause this is... Uh, it's sad to say, but, uh, it's like animals."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael," (over phone) You know, maybe we'll do this another time. It's sad to say, but, it's, uh, it's left me pretty shaken up. God, I just hope there are no kids on that plane. 'Cause, you know, they don't have any choice in the matter."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," Well, I'll tell you what. I feel worse for the parents... okay? Probably the kids thought that they could fly the plane all by themselves. Bet you 500 bucks they find a dead kid behind the stick. You know, or maybe on the dead dad's lap whose only fault was loving that kid too much and letting him fly the plane. Next thing he knows, he's bouncing off the top of the Sports Chalet onto the express lane of the 605. I'll bet you 500 bucks."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, Michael was hurt and on his way out... 
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," Okay, thank you."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator, ...when he heard something that cheered him up.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Guard," The guy that was harassing Rebel, he's on his way down."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," Did you say Rebel? Hey, Andy Richter! Michael Bluth. How you doing, Andy?"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rocky Richter," Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Andy."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," So, I know him. Can I get on your membership, and... can you vouch for me? Okay?"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rocky Richter," Oh, yeah, sure. Whatever you want, it's on Andy."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael, Thank you.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Rocky Richter, It's on this rich (BLEEP). Bye.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Narrator," But before Michael could find Rebel, he ran into the man that, at that point he still thought..."

4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Ron Howard, Oh.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," And we're gonna meet here tonight, but I think that he's blowing me off."
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Ron Howard," Well, yeah, kids will be kids, right?"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Michael," Well, you know, a month ago, I would have told you that he and I were exactly the same, that we were twins. You know, but now, I wouldn't even think of my son as my brother. (Ron walks off) You know, the thing is that y... He's busy."

4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Barry, Could you put in a good word on the missing Lucille 2 case? That's a career maker. That's an O.J. You just need one of those.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Jonah Feinberg," Ah, uh, excuse me, but was it or was it not my client who put up the initial seed money for the block software that served as the underlying architecture of Fakeblock?"
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,George Michael, It was 99 cents!
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,P-Hound/Jonah Feinberg,  Times three.
4,It Gets Better,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_It_Gets_Better,Barry, Times three. (momentary silence) Can I say something to my client? Take to the sea!

4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, Buster had come a long way since his fear of boats...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, ...was conquered...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, (BLEEP) baby. 
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," ...and then rekindled, only to find himself facing a bigger fear."

4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, But his biggest fear wasn't confronting a wet loose seal...

4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lupe, That's my perfume.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Good. Okay, good. She wouldn't wear that."

4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, What? (turns back to dummy) But that would take hours. 
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," This is going to be just stunning. You are always so right. (giggles) And then the waiter came back, and he said, ""Oh, I'm sorry. Who are you?"" And I said, ""I'm Buster Bluth. That's the fourth time I've told you."""

4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, (looking at mini vodka bottle) Aw. Cute.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, But the emotional lift was temporary.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," And before long, things had gotten weird."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Put the olive on top and you set it down for Mother.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," To an uninformed observer, it looked a little like that Vince Vaughn movie, Psycho."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," I agree. Dancing With the Stars has gone completely downhill. ""That pasta's way overcooked, Buster!"" Well, you didn't leave me the simplest recipe, Mother."

4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille," You win again, Buster. I know what's going to stump you. Close your eyes tight and plug your ears."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, Just plug one ear and press the other one to the couch.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Mm-hmm.

4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And Buster refined a testimony that was meant to spare Lucille from jail...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, and a fish swam by my ankle. That really happened. Should I keep that?"

4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Okay. (shouting) It's gonna be an eel! 
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Barry, Better. 
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Michael," Congratulations, Mother, you've managed to combine people's fear of homosexuals and eels into one alibi."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille," And he'll be wearing his Army uniform, so I can pretend I'm proud of him again."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, I couldn't find my Army uniform. Oh! But I thought the jury might like it if I show up as John-John Kennedy.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille," Oh, yeah, that went over great last time."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, And it was offensive! Half your testicle was hanging out of that thing.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Good! I'm glad they saw it. It was like a Motherboy Ball, right?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,George Michael, ...Hi.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Hi.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille," Put on your new uniform, with long pants. And keep your ball joke to yourself, Andrew Dice Clay. So you can see why I need the testimony of someone who's not a hot mess."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, You're a hot mess!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, You're a hot mess!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Michael, Let me get this straight. You won't let me help with your case...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," And the night before the trial, tensions had only gotten worse."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, It sure would be a shame if something happened to your pretty little key witness. 
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille," You need me just as much as I need you, cookie."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, really? Because you can be replaced, you know."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, Can she?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," And even if you can't, you're not the boss of me. Can I go to-? I'm going to the park!"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2," Oh, Buster! Hello!"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Hello to you too, 2. Oh, look at all this produce."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, I'm juicing now. Would you like to join me?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, It's two o'clock in the afternoon...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2," Honey, it's 8 a.m. somewhere. Oh, I forgot. Your mother wouldn't allow it."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Oh- I don't care what she wants! (lowers voice) Don't care what she wants. I don't do everything she tells me. Let's get juiced.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, The next morning Buster awoke with a vicious juice hangover.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Hey. (spots hacked-up dummy) Well, that was a freebie. Oh! Mother's trial!"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Key witness! Key witness coming through! I'm a key w- I was making two ban...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Drill Sergeant," (singing) Late last night, it was drizzling rain..."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Soldiers," (singing) Late last night, it was drizzling rain..."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, I'm a key witness...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Is it over?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Judge Kornzucker," No, no, the Grab-a-Crab fest just started."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Grab-a-Crab? Oh, ma'am, is, is, is there a verdict in the ""My mother stole the Queen Mary"" thing?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Waitress, It's all up on the dailies board.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Dailies? What? Clam- (screams on seeing verdict)
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, The fish is frozen here! It's frozen! Do you really want to spend $30 on frozen fish? Buster! Where were you? This is all your fault.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," No, I was making, was making a ban- I was making two ban-"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, Save it. I can smell the cran-apple on you from here.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, oh- when are you, where are you coming home?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, I'm serving three to five.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Like the saltless pie?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille," I hope your juicy blender bender was worth it. Don't come to visit me because I won't see you! Oh, and good luck with your night terrors. Now no one will be there to hear your screams! (Buster screams) Won't miss it!"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Where do, where do I go? What do I do? Where- (to Barry) Where'd you get the pirate hat? Where do, where do I go?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," And so Buster went back to the penthouse, feeling guilty and alone. And he couldn't bear to relive the time he was there without Lucille before."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, I can't go through another two days like that.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And that's how Buster decided to make another go at making another go at Lucille 2.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, Buster.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," My mother's gone away, and I thought, you've always been like a..."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, Girlfriend.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Not what I was going to say! Anyways, I was over there, and my friend's over here, and I thought, maybe I should just move in! Because I love to hear all about your medications and ailments and whatnot. Is that baby toe of your still crawling over the others like a weird weed?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2," Oh, Buster, how sweet of you to remember."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, it's one of my night terrors."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2," But listen, Buster, before I invite you into my arms, my bedroom, my bathtub with the railing..."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Mm.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, I have to ask you something. 
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Mm-hmm.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, Are you sure you're ready for this?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," So that pretend kid's bedroom, is that not an option...?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2," No, that room is all storage now, honey. So, yes or no? Are you ready to let go of your mother?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," Buster thought he was, although there was one ominous sign."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," I am ready for that, Lucille."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, Did you hear it?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, Wait! Did you just drop the 2 after my name?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, (laughs) I hope not! That would be creepy.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, no 2 was spoken.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," Every day, Buster visited the prison where his mother was incarcerated."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Buster Bluth and pie for his... Lucille Bluth.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," And every day, she refused to see him."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, No.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Guard, She doesn't want to see you.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Excellent. (faceplants into pie and cries)
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, He even pretended to be an old college flame of Lucille's to gain admittance.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Hello.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, Alex Trebek?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, She then rephrased it in the form of a question.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, Who is Alex Trebek?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Guard, Buster.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Guard," No, Buster."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Hmm. ...Do you have a pie or small sponge cake available?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Ah.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Guard, Here you go.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And while his days were spent trying to get his mother to love him...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2," Ooh, Buster!"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, ...his nights were concerned with getting his lover to mother him.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, You're just in time. I hope you are in the mood for a hot tomato.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Mmm. Soup? With little grilled cheese sandwiches on the side?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, Buster. That was innuendo.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Oh.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2," My Lord, it's like we're speaking different languages here."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," No, it's not. It is working. I'm getting hungry."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, For love?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, No. Is this another one of those nights where nothing is as it seems and there's no cream pie for dessert?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2," Holy Toledo, Buster, sometimes I think I'm nothing but a Horn & Hardart to you."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Ohh... what happened to innuendo? Let's do it quick.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, It's an old restaurant.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Oh! A restaurant! I don't care if it's old! Look who I'm dating! Let's go there. Let's go there now.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2," Buster. You can either be a son or a lover. And right now, you're no good to me as a lover."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Maybe you're right. Maybe this has been wrong from the start. Mom.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, Out.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And since he couldn't bear to go back to the penthouse...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, Out!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Storage Dave," (on TV) You know, if tomorrow you don't open up and let someone else in..."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, ...Buster needed to raise some money.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Storage Dave, ...then the treasures you have inside...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, This is my Motherboy IV medal. That's when I was a kangaroo in her pouch. What'll you give me for it?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, But Buster wasn't the first Motherboy to hit hard times.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, (offering hook jewels) What will you give me for these? (as man removes them) All-time low.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And that's when Buster found inspiration.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, She certainly looks proud of her son.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, I'm baaack!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," As it turned out, Buster returned on the very day the Army policy regarding sexual orientation had changed."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Look who's back...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Drew, Are you gay?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, No.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Drew, You can tell me.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, I'm not.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Peters," It's okay. Drew, tell him."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Drew, I'm gay.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Oh.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Drew, Peters is gay. Sergeant Melnick's gay.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Sergeant Melnick, Bye.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Drew," Oh, sorry, he's bi."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Sergeant Melnick," No, I'm going home for the day. I'm gay."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Peters," Yeah, it really makes no difference to us. We'll find something for you."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Perfect. I was looking for something. You said ""something,"" right?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And that's how Buster officially reenlisted in the Army.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," And it's why, six months later..."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Sergeant Briggs, Lucille Bluth?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, ...Lucille Bluth got some bad news.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, Yes?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Sergeant Briggs, I'm here to see you about your son.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille," Oh, this is a ploy. He's trying to get me to see him. How do I know you're really in the Army? Who did Larry Kert replace in Company?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Sergeant Briggs," I don't know. I know who he thought he was replacing, and it was Dean Jones. But he didn't come close."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, My Buster?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And Lucille rushed to the hospital.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, What happened? Where's my son?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Literal Doctor," Mrs. Bluth, your son went down while piloting a plane over Afghanistan."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille," Oh, my God."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Literal Doctor," He deserves a big hand for that and we gave him one. I'm afraid, besides that, there's nothing we can do."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Hi, Mother."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille," Well, you look fine. The doctor said you went down while piloting a plane over Afghanistan."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, yeah, that plane was in Afghanistan."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, It seems the Army had taken advantage of childlike interest in games.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, This is so much more fun than Guess the Fur.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And his childlike inability to distinguish between games and reality.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Oh! (laughs)
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, So they set him up as a drone pilot here.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Colonel Smalls," Want to go to lunch, Private Bluth?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Not till I take out the hospital!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Colonel Smalls," I tell you, this kid's amazing. If I had him back in the 60s, Cuba would be the 51st state."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," You're not gonna get away from me, little nurse! Ah!"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, He had been playing for 47 straight hours.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Next time! Take that, Taliban wedding! (laughs)"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," But like anyone who plays video games for too long, he started to make mistakes."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Trippler," Hey, Bluth, you just took out an art museum in Madrid."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, You can go to Spain in this thing?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Trippler, Maybe you should take a break. You could've hurt some innocent people.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Innocent people? You mean I've been hurting guilty people! Oh!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, But Buster was a peaceful man.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Trippler," Stop it, you're strapped in!"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, God!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Trippler, Pilot down!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, It was the kind of emergency that the drone pilot paramedics had long been waiting for.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Trippler, Medic! Where the hell's the medic! I got a man down!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Medic, Sorry we're late. Some kid swallowed an eye at the Build-a-Bear.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Trippler, Why do they have us at a mini-mall?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," It was the first known injury to a drone pilot, and the Army took it seriously."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Colonel Grimm, Apparently no one told him that they were real planes. If this guy comes after us they could pull funding for the whole program.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Colonel B. Arthur," So, how do we buy off ol' One Arm?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Colonel Grimm, First we gotta find something he needs.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Colonel Smalls," Well, we do have the bionics program."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Private King, Ice cream!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Colonel Smalls, Maybe we shouldn't be discussing this here.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Colonel Grimm," Yeah, I think we're at those kids' table."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille," So, you fell out of a chair, and for this the government gives you applause?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, No. A big hand. (points to oversized bionic hand)
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, I thought I recognized that little son of a bitch. (yelling at Literal Doctor) This is why you can't keep a job at one hospital! (to Buster) Why does it have to be so big?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Well, they said the miniaturization comes later. I mean, you remember how big your first cell phone was."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, That was a phone. This looks like you're pointing to a place that buys your gold.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, I haven't learned how to control it yet. They're gonna work with me.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille," So, you had me come out here under false pretenses?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," You wouldn't come here any other way! You haven't seen me in a year. It's why I went to Army, to win you back. You have to forgive me."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, It's not about forgiving you! Although I don't.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Huh.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille," You need to grow up, Buster, because I can't take care of you anymore. I need to get away, get away. You're hopelessly hopeless, Buster. It's as if they wrote that song for my own son."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Hmm?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, I'm glad you have a new hand. But you need to find someone else to hold it. Tell the prison limo to come around!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Guard, (into radio) Bring the limo round.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Fine! I got my own family now! Army! And they want me. You guys want me, right?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Literal Doctor," Oh, yeah. They're not gonna invest this kind of money without wanting you for keeps."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, good."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Literal Doctor," Once you learn how to use that thing, they're gonna turn you into a killing monster."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Monster?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Literal Doctor, (removing fake mustache) This doesn't make me look sexy. Throw it out.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Well, that explains the photo shoot."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And so Buster began a rehab program he was terrified to succeed at.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Therapist," Okay, uh, open the cabinet, please. (Buster thumps cabinet) Whoa."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Too hard.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Therapist," Uh, I think that was too hard."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Yeah.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Therapist," Yeah. Okay. Let's just grab, um... that toothpaste. Use your new hand."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, (squirting toothpaste) Oh! I got some on you.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Therapist, Uh... yeah. You did get some on me.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Yeah. Too hard?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, Buster seemed slow to master the challengers.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Gunner," Yeah, that's, that's on her."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Armstrong, He got a little...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Gunner, It was too hard.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Armstrong, I think it was as well.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Therapist," Let's go ahead and fast-forward through the commercials. Okay, that's too fast. Okay, stop. Well, there's Jon Cryer. Stop! That's Jon Cryer! (sighs) Well, look at that. We're back at the Progressive Insurance lady."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, I'm better off just watching the commercials!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Therapist, Don't say that!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," But behind the two-way mirror, hope wasn't in abundance."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Gunner," Hope this guy likes the music acts on Saturday Night Live, because he's gonna be watching a lot of them. How many remotes do we have?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Armstrong, That was the only one.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Gunner," There's seven monitors here, we have one remote? Do we have anybody from Pinky Team?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Therapist," Guys, he can't do this!"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," And around week five, the Army finally realized that Buster was in no hurry to leave."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," (cheerfully) Ah, I blew it again! I'll never do it right! I'm a monst- Do you have any ice-cream? Maybe it would work with ice-cream."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Gunner, And now he wants ice-cream.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Armstrong, He's using us.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Colonel Smalls," Yeah, it might be time for the Q-test."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Gunner, The Q-test?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Armstrong," (entering) I'm sorry, we're running behind with your testing, Buster, we'll... just be a few more minutes."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Okay. (gasps)
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And it was then that Gunner learned why it was called the Q-test.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Oh! Aren't you the cutest?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Colonel Smalls," Now. He can't... see us at all, that's correct?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, (to kitten) Hello. I know!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Gunner, Why wouldn't he be able to see us?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, (to kitten) You lookin' around? You looking?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Colonel Smalls, Because it's a mirror.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Armstrong," No, it's... a window."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," (to kitten) Ohh, hi."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Colonel Smalls," Okay, let's take it down."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, (to kitten) I know you do. I know! I know you...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Colonel Smalls, Send in the authority figure. 
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, (to kitten) Hi.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Fake General," How are you managing with that hand, soldier?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Uh? (whimpers)
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, Buster was being discharged from the Army.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," So, where am I supposed to go? What am I supposed to do? I, I have nowhere to live."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Nurse, You should have thought about that before you let that cat live.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And that's when he met Ophelia Love.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, I'm sorry."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, The devoted wife of the candidate Herbert Love...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, I have nowhere to go.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, ...who was on a tour of the Veterans' Hospital.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love, Ex...cuse me? You're a veteran and you have nowhere to go?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, it's not Army's fault. I'm a monster."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love, And what makes you think you're a monster?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, What do you see when you look at this? (holds up hand)
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love, I see a veteran whose hand I'd like to shake. ...Not that one. (shakes his good hand) I think you should meet my husband. We may have something for you.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Perfect! Wait, you didn't say ""nothing,"" did you?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love, Something.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Something. Got it.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Herbert Love, Look how big his hand is.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, But Herbert would be less enthusiastic.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Herbert Love, And you want him to live with us?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love," Well, he's a vet, Herbert. And you yourself said you need something to compete with the woman you're running against."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, Lucille 2 had recently adopted a Hispanic boy named Perfecto.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love," And since you're never around, I mean, he could help me with the boys. It's like that movie The Blind Side."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Herbert Love, I suppose we could use a Blind Side monster.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love," Well, we shouldn't call him a monster."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Herbert Love," That's why I love you, Ophelia. You've got a heart as big as that Blind Side monster's hand."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And so it was decided Buster was to stay with the Love family.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," He's fine, he's fine."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Herbert Love, Welcome to the family.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Oh!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, He'd found a home at last.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Herbert Love, Oh!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, uh-uh-uh. (switches hands)"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," In the following weeks, Buster came in handy to the entire Love family. Helping the boys at school."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Bully, This table is for National Honor Society members only.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Really? Well, what about these two guys? Were they invited? Light Drizzle (raises good hand) and Thunder. (raises giant hand)"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Bully, What?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," See, Light Drizzle will just annoy you. But, you see, Thunder will F you up!"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," This got the attention of Perfecto Telles, vice president of the student anti-bullying squad. Buster even received a badge from an undercover cop who was posing as a teacher."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Rocky Richter," You're never too old to stand up to a bully. Whether he's an attention hog who looks just like you, or whether he's half your size."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, He used his finely-honed skills as a doting son to give the long-neglected Ophelia some much-deserved attention.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," (singing) Pour in the liquor. Don't want the boys to see. You throw in some cola. Got a Coke and Hennessy! Just for you, Mother Love."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love, Buster. You are the most considerate man I've ever met.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, stop! You're embarrassing me."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love," And sweet, and..."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," No, I'm serious. Stop, stop."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love, But your other hand is waving me on.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, is that going again? I think it's on demo. Do you have a pencil or a paperclip?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And he helped Herbert on the campaign trail.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Herbert Love, Let me show you what a government handout looks like. Hold your government hand out. Yeah! And let's give freedom from government a big thumbs-up!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, Although he hadn't achieved complete mastery.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Herbert Love," Oh! Oh. Come on, Buster, dance."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Don't wanna dance.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Herbert Love," Come on, dance, Buster."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, Buster was enjoying his new role as a symbol of government waste.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Herbert Love," And this hand ain't the only thing the government wastes money on. It's like I said about contraception. If you want me to pay for her diaphragm, I get to put my hand in her..."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, (blocking thrown shoe) Shoe!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Herbert Love," Nice stop, Blind Side monster. Buster! Blind Side Buster."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And he was feeling more confident every day.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Okay.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Herbert Love, Give him a big hand back!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, Arguably too confident.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Herbert Love, Hey!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," Although, after this appearance, he spent a lot less time with Herbert."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And a lot more time with Ophelia. Which is what led to this.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," That's funny, no smoke came out."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love, Smoke?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Wait, what just happened?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love, This. (kissing him again)
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Okay, okay. Okay! So, you don't think that the next level is adult adoption, do you?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love," Come on, Buster. You've been flirting with me since day one."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, What?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love, Bringing me these flowers. Offering to undress me. What about the singing? Sealed With a Kiss through the door while I bathed?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Right! Mother stuff. (whispering) I mean, you're married."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, What is this?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love," That is my husband, with a prostitute."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," I've worn a captain's hat with someone who had hair like that. But I, I can't do- I mean, you're like a mother to me."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love, You can either be a son or a lover to me. And I already have two sons.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," And perhaps it was the fear that she'd throw him out, or he finally did grow up, but that night, Buster acted like a man."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," After spending the night with Ophelia Love, Buster proudly went to visit his mother."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," I came here to thank you. You were trying to push me out of the nest, and you were right."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, Really?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Yes. I've grown. And I'm in love.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, Hamster or turtle?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," No, Mother. Hamsters are gross. It's a female. Human. Female human. Whole thing. So, your parental responsibilities are complete. (goes to drink coffee)"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, Hot.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Hot. I no longer need you.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille," Well, you don't have to go that far."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, I'm not a mother boy anymore. I'm a mother man. (struggles to open door)
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille, Use your good hand.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, (accidentally pulling off the handle) Guards!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," And on his way back to his new love, Buster ran into Michael..."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Michael!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Michael, Buster. Hey! Listen. Look what I've got. This is for your life rights...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, ...who was trying to get the life story rights from one of the few remaining family members he hadn't thrown out of the movie.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Michael, ...just sign there. I've got Tobias... I don't have George Michael yet.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, What about Mom?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Michael," I have her, but I'm about to throw it in her face when I see her. And I can't go to my son."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Well, I have nothing to be ashamed about. I'm in love. And do you want to hear something so surprising? She started out as my mother figure."

4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, okay."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And he returned back to his love nest to tell Ophelia the good news.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Ophelia? Oph- I'm out of the thing! How did yours go?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love," It's over. I talked to Herbert, I told him everything about us, and it's over."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Mmm. I know it's scary. I just got out of a long relationship, too. But I am here for you. And girl, I ain't going nowhere."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love, I need you to leave.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," So let's get it on... Wait, what's happening?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love," He wants to try to change. He wants a second chance, and I want to give it to him."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," But... So you were, you were just using me to hurt him?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love, Yes. Thank you.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," But what, what about me? What happens to me? I, I certainly can't go back to you as my mother. After I've zipped down, you can't expect me to zip up!"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love, I know that. But you have to leave.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, no. I'm okay with the mothering. I mean, he had you first, I'm here to stay. This is just a little mother-son bump in the road. Mother, I ain't going nowhere."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love, Your hand is broken again.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," No. It's just my heart. Oh, it's my hand too, actually."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love," I'm sorry, Buster."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, Buster was blindsided.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Ophelia! Tell me this. Who is a better lover?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Ophelia Love, He is.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, He is. Okay. What about son?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," Buster was hurt. And perhaps that's why he availed himself to the photos of Herbert and the prostitute. And Buster, furious, decided to expose Herbert himself."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, But not before using the wrong hand to punch a picture of Herbert.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Stupid Bust- (smacks himself in the forehead with his giant hand)
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," Unfortunately, it was the night of Cinco, and no one was home to find him."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, (snapping awake) Sad! Sad.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," Buster came to and rushed to Cinco to share the photos with Herbert Love's political enemy, when he ran into Tobias, who enlisted Buster's help for a musical that was becoming less fantastic every minute."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Tobias," Buster! Oh, thank God. I need your help. I've got a show to do in 10 minutes, and I haven't got a thing to wear. This Thing suit... "
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, But... I've got to find Lucille 2. I've got to give her pictures. I don't know the songs!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Tobias, It's pre-recorded. You're a monster! You don't have to be any good. 
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, What? 
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Tobias," Now, just go ""Thing"" your heart out, and don't be put off by the freakishly large- What? Oh, God! Okay, well, well, good. Then just the, uh, the one glove will do, and, uh... Perfecto!"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," As fate would have it, Perfecto Telles was also in need of a monster."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Maeby," He's a bully. So I want you to ""bad cop"" him for me a little, okay? Yeah, yeah."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And that's when he heard his name.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Tobias, That's... Perfecto!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Perfecto Telles," (to Buster) And, he's a real bully. He's taking money from this innocent young high school girl."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Oh. I don't think I can help you.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Perfecto Telles, Please.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, I don't wanna be a monster anymore.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Perfecto Telles, Can't you just show him a little Thunder? Just to scare him a bit?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And that's when Buster saw the woman he'd come for.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, I'm sorry. I have to take care of something. Lucille 2. I've been looking for you.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, Buster! You look different. Something's happened to you.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Yes. I've been with a black woman.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, I was talking about your hand.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh. This huge thing? Yeah, it's new. Of course, the week after I got it, the six came out. You can play a flute with that one. It comes with a flute! But I'm not here about that. I'm here about this."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, What is this?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, just pictures of Herbert Love with a lady of the night. And he's gotten himself in some pretty hot ham water this time. I want you to humiliate him and win the election."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2," That's my wig. Buster, this is priceless. Why are you giving it to me?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Because I want to hurt him.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, I've never known you to want to hurt anybody.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Well, I hurt my mother, didn't I? I missed her trial, and she cut me out of her life. But I'm over that!"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2, Really? Then you have me to thank for that.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, What do you mean?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2," Oh, Buster! You think missing her trial was an accident?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Yes.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2," Buster, I helped you with that."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, What?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," Although ""helped"" might not be the best description of what she did."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," In fact, she'd been laying in wait for him."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2," Oh, Buster! Hello!"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," And once she'd gotten Buster into the apartment, she eschewed the all-natural juice for the kind with cartoon animals and riddles on the box. The type Buster had been known to have a weakness for."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Thank you.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," And soon the partying was off the hook, with Buster drinking right out of the box."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, this is just like a Mother's Day Eve!"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, ...Mrs. Williams comes right into the restroom while I'm tinkling.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," Although, at one point, he did have something close to an insight."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," I mean, how do you miss a sign like that?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, I was tinkling! (laughs)
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, You kept me from Mother? You sent her to prison? And this whole time I thought about getting back together with you.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Lucille 2," Well, you're a little late, honey, I've been dating your father for the past couple of weeks."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator," Buster was in a whirl. Confused and betrayed, he wanted to punch something. Which is why he went here."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Hey! I need to punch something! Even if it is a poor little donkey.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, But it wasn't that kind of Donkey Punch.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, I need some juice."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Gene Parmesan," Perhaps uno más, señor, to feed to the fishes? (low) Gene Parmesan. This is not my real job."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And that's when Buster heard his target.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Herbert Love," Okay, I, I'll talk to you later. I got to go up and give my speech."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, You.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Herbert Love," Oh, hey. It's the Blind Side monster."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And so he blindsided him and became one. And it was amidst the rampaging of the blowback that a juiced up Buster noticed something horrifying.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Oh, no. I'm in the movie. Oh, no."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, On the next Arrested Development.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, Buster tries to cover his tracks.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Hey, nephew! (George Michael screams) New hand."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,George Michael, It's cool. That's cool.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, You know that super-duper privacy software you have? Does that work on security cameras?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,George Michael," Of course, yeah. It works on... everything."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, May I borrow it?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,George Michael," One second. (leaves and returns) Here you go, Uncle Buster. I put it on a hard drive for you. Just please, be careful with it."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Of course, of course. (crushes it) You got one with a case?"
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Hey, Carl."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Carl, Buster!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, How are you? What is all this?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, And Buster visits a Balboa Towers guard he'd known for many years...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Carl," I, I get to watch everybody..."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, ...for an impromptu lesson on how their footage is gathered and stored.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, May I use to your phone to...?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, But when Carl steps away...
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Carl, I'll be right back.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Narrator, Buster goes into action and attempts to Fakeblock the footage.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Oh. Sounds like it's working.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Carl, Buster!
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Hey, Carl."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Carl, Everything okay?
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster," Mm-hmm. Bye, Carl."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Carl," Bye-bye, Buster."
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Buster, Okay.
4,Off the Hook,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Off_the_Hook,Carl, What she did to this boy...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, George Michael was playing a game of lie tag with his father.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, How far away are you?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Wait, I bet we're sitting in the exact same traffic. God, I just hope there are no kids on that plane."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," 500 bucks they find a dead kid behind the stick. You know, or maybe on the dead dad's lap whose only fault was loving that kid too much and letting him fly the plane."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," Currently, each claimed to be stuck in traffic behind a light aircraft that had landed on the 605 Freeway."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," And, and, you know what? One more thing. I think I accidentally had the phone flipped around. I recorded my face the whole time, you know? Smartphone, stupid man. Pal, why don't you loop around and film this thing? Someone's got to tell the story."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, Michael hung up feeling confident he'd had the last word.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Kidding me?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Missed you again, damn. But, you know, I got out of my car here, and I'm standing here now with a paramedic named Tim Ridge- Ridgley... Can I record some video over there?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Waiter, No cameras allowed.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, No camera... They're being real tight-assed about this camera thing.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, But George Michael was proving more adept at lying than anyone suspected.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," I guess it's just not on the cards tonight. Getting back in my car now. You know, just thank God we weren't on that plane."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, Which would come in handy with a woman who only knew him as George Maharis.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Hey.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Hey!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Hey, sorry, that was my dad. He can be kinda hard to get off the phone sometimes."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Tell me about it. At least he wasn't drunk and bitching about Don Ameche not knowing his lines in Cocoon.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Y-y- he's actually great. If anything, I've been kind of a lousy son lately, but, you know, it's just... I mean, at some point, I've got to start living my life."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," No, I know. I mean, my dad is the nicest guy in the world, but he just doesn't get it. I have to live my life my way. It's like he's always checking up on me. Does yours do that?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," (spotting Michael) Yeah, no, once in a while. Hey, you wanna go in here? (ducks into photo booth)"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," (spotting Ron Howard) Yeah, okay."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Ron!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Ron Howard, Hey.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," No, no. It's Michael. Michael Bluth. Doing the film about my family, and... "
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Ron Howard," Yeah, when are we gonna get your kid's signature, though? "
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Yeah, I'm working on it."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Ron Howard," Well, yeah, kids will be kids, right? "
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," I would have told you that he and I were exactly the same, that we were twins. You know, but now, I wouldn't even think of my son as my brother."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," Although, in fairness, this is something a Bluth brother would do."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, George Michael was a new man. He had finally cast off the shackles of his cautious persona...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Oh! (catches ball)
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Man," Come on, man, throw it."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...and he was ready to play with the big boys.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Okay, I'm good."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Man, You all right?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," That's it for me, you guys keep playing. Oh, too funny."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," But later, at the student health center, he was reminded of the man who'd always supported him."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Nurse, Who would you like us to call in case of an emergency?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, And who he'd now twice hurt.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, My dad.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Nurse, We're gonna need an actual...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," And that night, Michael, trying to impress Rebel by being a down-to-earth rich guy, although by doing so he was neither..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Oh, I'm not. I'm not. Are you saying that I am? Maybe Ron Howard is, but I, I mean, I don't know. But I'm not. And I am also not (cell phone rings) one of those Beverly Hills billionaires who can't go two minutes without putting his phone to his-"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...got this call.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, I got to take this. Hold on one second. Hello?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Hey, George Michael. Are you, you stuck in traffic, pal?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," No. You know, I just feel terrible that we couldn't get together the other night, and, uh, I miss you, you know, but I'm free all night if you wanted..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Listen, I'm in the middle of a, of a film meeting..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, But Michael hadn't forgiven George Michael.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," ...people in politics involved, and I just... you know, I can't get away this time."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, It seemed the two men were growing less alike every day. And although George Michael felt guilty...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," Oh, God, I've got to get this. It could be my agent. Hello?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," ...George Maharis was already planning his evening with, as it turned out, someone who had also just been put off by his father."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Hi, Rebel, it's George Mi- ...haris. My night just... freed up, and I was wondering if you wanted..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, I thought you were having dinner with your dad.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Well, you know, older guys, the night ends for them at 8."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," I think I could use a break from the old guys. And, I've already got some birth control in me that I paid for myself, and I'd hate to let it go to waste."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Well, that's perfect, because I'm... not quite ready to have children."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," So, as he straightened up his room, he got this call."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Hey, Dad."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," George Michael, hey. Got out of it. I, just, I made a ton of people angry, but you know what I always say, ""Family..."" "
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Well, uh, gosh, you know I really wanted to, uh, do that, but I just had this... work thing come up, and, uh, it's like, it's like you always say, ""Family first, unless there's a work thing, and then... work first."""
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," I have said that too. Uh, so... another time."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Okay.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, But he had another problem he had to deal with.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, P-Hound.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,P-Hound," Hey, George Michael!"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Hey.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,P-Hound," Look, I got us a peace pizza."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Oh, that's grea- Hey, you've got to go."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,P-Hound, What did you do with my stuff?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," I've just got a girl coming over, and..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,P-Hound, Maeby?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," It's not Maeby, no. But, um... could you please leave?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,P-Hound," Okay. First, you F me with Fakeblock, and then you're gonna kick me out when you have a hottie coming over? I have roommate rights."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Well, you know what? You voided your rights when you took this picture of Maeby brushing her teeth."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,P-Hound, Not against the rules.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Still a little weird, don't you think?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,P-Hound, But not against the rules!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Well...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,P-Hound, You know what? This is no longer a peace pizza. That is a war pizza!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Okay, that's fine. Do you want to take it back, or...?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,P-Hound," No, I already ate. That, that's for you."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Oh, thank you."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,P-Hound, You're welcome. Enjoy your war pizza!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, The pizza hadn't even cooled before Rebel arrived.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Hi.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," Hey. Oh, so this is a dorm."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, This is a dorm.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," Well, I suppose anything goes in a dorm."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," You got that right. (they kiss) Although, we should probably go inside because they don't like us hanging out in the hallways, actually."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Oh.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Yeah.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, George Michael had just officially gotten over Maeby.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Thanks for, uh, keeping it down for my RA. You were keeping it down, right?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, You know what really impresses me about you? How little you try to impress me.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Well, I am to not please."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," I just came from a dinner with this right-wing politician, and his date who was an actual hooker."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Oh, my God, they sound like terrible people."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," Oh, they were. So, wait, is this where you conceived Fakeblock?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," It was George Michael's first chance to truly be unpretentious and undo the big lie. On the other hand, she thought he was an unpretentious software genius. If she were to learn that he was merely a woodblock player with a heightened ability to track the passage of time, perhaps she would rightly feel lack of pretension should be a given. It was after second 23 that he said..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Twenty-four. Yes, it was, uh, right in here."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Wow.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Yeah.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, This is like making love with the Wright brothers in their bicycle shop.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," I'm sure she just meant one of them. Hey, how about her knowing they had a bicycle shop?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Just a little token of my, uh..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, The next morning he walked her to her car.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," Listen, I gotta go shoot a PSA. I'll text you from the car."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Oh, no, don't, don't do-"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Ron Howard, Action.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Tweet and drive.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Ron Howard," Yeah, that was good, but it's ""text,"" and we need the word ""don't."""
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," And upon returning to his dorm, he discovered that P-Hound had officially filed a grievance with the student housing office."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Doug Fleer," So P-Hound claims that George Michael - make a note of that, that's one person..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Dean Fleer," Oh, I know, I know."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Doug Fleer, ...messed with his stuff and stole some software thing?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Dean Fleer," Yeah, and, uh, George Michael claims that nobody can live with P-Hound. Somebody's got to go."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Doug Fleer," O-okay, it's time for a vote. We'll each get one vote."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Oh, well, that doesn't really seem fair, because you guys are obviously gonna vote for the same person."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Dean Fleer," Oh, right, yeah, 'cause, uh, we're twins, and, uh, we have no sense of ourselves as individuals. That's right."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Dean/Doug, Fine. We'll each get a half vote.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, And the four men cast their three votes.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Doug Fleer," It's a tie, uh... one and a half to one and a half."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, The twins were proud to show that they voted differently from one another.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Dean Fleer," Ah, we're gonna need a tiebreaker, ugly."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," Fortunately, they were able to bring in two more half voters..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Doug Fleer, It's a tie!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...who also proved...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Doug Fleer, Two to two.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...they were capable of having opposite opinions.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Dean Fleer, Double tie! Yeah!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Doug Fleer, Yeah!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Dean/Doug, Whoo!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," To break the tie, more members of twin club joined the electorate."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Doug Fleer, We have - a quadruple tie!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Dean Fleer," Oh, unbelievable."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, Which also jammed up the works.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Doug Fleer, Yeah!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Dean Fleer," Yeah, go, yeah!"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Maybe we should just bring in a single person now.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Doug Fleer," You mean, like, not, not a twin?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Yeah, just to speed things along... a little."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, And perhaps it was that comment...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Lucas Brother #1," I guess one head's better than two, huh? Twin hater."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Lucas Brother #2, We've been dealing with twincists like you all our lives.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...that united the voting body into a greater cause than expressing their individuality. And with the exception of George Michael's vote...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Doug Fleer, P-Hound. George Michael. George Michael. George Michael. George Michael. George Michael.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...and one other curiosity...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Doug Fleer, George Michael. Bender from Futurama?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Andrew, I almost wrote that. (his twin snickers)
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...it was a George Michael blitz.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Doug Fleer," Ah, George Michael, and, oh, a half vote for ""George Michael, twincist."""
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Lucas Brother #2," See you later, twin hater."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," I, no, I'm not..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Dean Fleer, Uh-uh. Shh. Go.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, And now wishing he'd actually packed the bag...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, I don't-
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,All, Shh!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," ...George Michael aimlessly headed out onto the campus, where as fate would have it, he ran into his beeping uncle."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Whoa. (BLEEP) What are you doing here?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B., I was in the neighborhood. I happened to remember how much you love bologna.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Huh?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B.," So, yeah, I just... I found this great ShopRite, and I just thought, ""You know who's got to have a taste of this...? Is young George Michael."" Now, you just let me- (tries to force him to eat it)"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, He didn't think George Michael liked bologna.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B., Take it. I know how you love bologna.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, He was trying to correct a bad impression he felt he might have made on his nephew a few nights earlier.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B., (after kissing George Michael) We're good.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," My God, Uncle G.O.B., what is this?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B.," Can't lie to you, George Michael. It's a Forget-Me-Now. I wanted you to forget what happened at that magic club. I was embarrassed."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Well, if you don't want me to tell anyone about it, I won't!"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B.," I'm such a fool. I... go to those things too quickly. Really, it's just the age we live in, isn't it? Take a pill to forget your problems. Take a pill to go to sleep. Then, take a pill to forget your problems. Need an erection, take a pill. Need to forget your problems, take a pill! Take a pill and your problems are forgotten. Take a pill. What an age we live in. It's great, isn't it? What's with the suitcase?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, I got kicked out of my dorm.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B., That was a freebie. You in the market to buy a house? It's a great time to buy.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Oh, I don't want to buy a house. I don't have that kind of money."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B.," Money? Oh, ninja, please. You don't need money. With the Fakeblock thing you got going and your great credit rating, we can put you in a Bluth in no time."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," Frankly, it wasn't the kind of risk George Michael would take. But then G.O.B. said something that changed his mind."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B.," Plus, it would make your dad proud. I know that he's still really disappointed about you, uh..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," What, that I blew him off?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B.," ...blew him off. Boy, is he disappointed about that."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, I would love to say yes...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B., Yes! There it is! I got my much-vaunted yes!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," G.O.B. felt good. He would be able to prove to his brother that he could actually sell a house. George Michael felt good, because he could prove to his father that he did indeed support him. And the residents of Sudden Valley felt good, because it turns out the very young-looking man who drove down their street that afternoon..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Hi!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Carlos," Oh, hello, young man."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Hi.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Carlos, How young are you?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," I'm good, how you doing?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Carlos," No, how young are you?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Well, I'm, I'm 22. 22 years young."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," ...was over 21, and they wouldn't have to search for a home that was even more remote."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Carlos, 22!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Yeah.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Carlos, You look 16. He's 22! He's 22 but looks 16!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Man, Wow!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, Sudden Valley residents wasted no time in welcoming George Michael to the community...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,All, Hey!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Hi.

4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...every chance they got.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Thank you. Uh, hi. Hello again. Welcome back. Hi. Hi."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Oh, it's so nice. Wow. Like it's my birthday."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Tom, It's like it's everyone's birthday.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Oh, this is... I wonder who this is from."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Terry," We said no clothes, Carlos."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Carlos, Hat is not clothes.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Tom, A hat is clothes.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Gosh, I wish I had something to offer you guys. You know, here you are, guests in my home, and you've gotten me these beautiful gifts. You know, feels like it should be the other way around."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Man, Football!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Tom," Hut, hut!"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Carlos! Carlos, you're on my team. You're on my team. Yo, guys, the play is dead. The play is dead. The ball touched the ground. Come on. The play is dead. Carlos, man, we're on the same team. Guys, maybe we, we can't play skins versus skins."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Tom, Tops versus bottoms?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, I gotta bring my girlfriend up here. she's gonna love it.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Tom," Let's throw her a party, Sudden Valley style."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," That actually sounds, yeah, fun."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," And so George Michael was proud to invite Rebel to see how successful George Maharis had become, and how many people were eager to be in his company."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," No, I'm fine, I'm fine, he was tickling me in there."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," Hey, uh, what is, what is all this?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Uh, it's just a little surprise."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, You did this for me?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Yes!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, But Rebel had other concerns.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, We need to talk. 
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,All, Ooh...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, This is it. This is the place. Hope you don't find it too pretentious.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," Well, what happened to the old, ""anything goes in the dorm""?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Well, I got this place instead. You know, I guess I wanted to... impress you. Uh, I'm gonna get some furniture, obviously. The guys from Homefill are coming this week."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Right.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, That's not the problem.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," No, that's not the problem."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Wrong house, buddy."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," No! This is my son, Lem Depardieu. Hey, baby."

4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Hey, Lem."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Lem, Hi!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," How you doing? I love kids. I'm great... You want a Twister? I was just given, like, four Twisters. You should take one."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Lem, Wow!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Go on, take a Twister."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," You know what, honey? D'you wanna give Mommy some alone time with her friend?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Maybe he could go play in the pool?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Yeah.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," He'll be totally safe, there's like a hundred guys out there."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Lem, Yay!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Make sure you wear your sunblock!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," In fact, it was the folks in the pool who were more at risk of being near Lem than he was of them."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, And perhaps that's what led to G.O.B. having to take out another ad.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Wow, what a great kid. You, you know, when I said I was... not eager to have kids, but I think it's great that you have a son. You know, I have a spare room here that the two of you could stay in. Or maybe you could just stay in it, and-"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," He doesn't live with me. He lives in France with his father. He just visits March and April during French pilot season, but that's what I'm talking about. I just don't want to get that serious."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Because you're seeing someone else?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," No! I mean, yes, I'm seeing someone else, but... I don't want to get serious with him, either. And you're out telling people in the neighborhood that we're seeing each other. What happened to the guy who founded Fakeblock? The guy who keeps things anonymous!"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, I can do anonymous. You know I'm all about staying anonymous. That's Fakeblock's mission statement.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," And now you're asking Lem and me to move into this house, and it just... it seems all backwards. (leaving) Sorry."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Maybe it is backwards.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, George Michael shared his relationship problem with the one other woman he'd had a relationship problem with.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Well, she's not really my girlfriend. I mean, I'm crazy about her, but she wants to keep things anonymous, and I don't know how to do that."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby," Oh, that's ridiculous."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Right.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby," You haven't told her your real name yet, have you?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," What? No, no. No, she still thinks I'm George Maharis. But she's dating another guy, which is probably the whole reason she's always saying I'm moving too fast. I take things too seriously. I take things too serious? I take things too seriously. I need to note which one of those is correct, because I sound like a horse's ass when I alternate between the two of them. I need to get my (BLEEP) together."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby, Yeah.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, But the point is that I take things... easily-breezily.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby," Well, a real serioush woman knows what she wants and moves quickly."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Serioush is nothing. It's not a word.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby, Are you ready to see your office?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," I have been. It's great, it's- I like it a lot. I wonder if she's gonna think... we've been a little lavish with money. You know, is it too much? But then, to contradict myself, I do think, at some point, it would be good to get a second chair, just in case we have a guest, but I'm thinking big picture."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," Of course, that wasn't his office."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby," Honey, this isn't your office. She's over here. This hangar can hold over 500 nerds! "
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, And it was at his actual desk that he made his first major decision as CEO.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Maeby? You're fired!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," And although Mort was prepared to be handed his walking papers, there was nothing that could have prepared George Michael for what Mort would leave on his desk."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," And so later that day, it was a disgruntled Maeby that ran into Michael..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby, Hey. 
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...as he was seeking a signature for his movie.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Doing a movie. 
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby, I think movies are dead. Maybe... it's a TV show. 
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," What? No. This girl that I'm dating, Rebel, she's gonna be in it, and she would never do TV."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby, You're dating Rebel... Alley?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Yeah. I have a picture of us to prove it. I can't find it, but yeah."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby, So... you're the other guy.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, You know her personally?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby," Yes. I mean, that's how I know that you were dating her."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Do you know the other guy that she's dating?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, And that's when she saw an opportunity to get back at George Michael.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby," No. No, but, um, I know it's over. She is dumping him."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, She's dumping him?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby, Apparently he was coming on too strong? Taking it too seriously. She hates that.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Is that what she said?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby," Yeah, that's what she told me. Just kills it for her. She wants it easily-breezily."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Well, that's... informative. I owe you. Thank you."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby," No, you don't."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Okay, wait, w-w-wait! Don't knock just-"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby, Okay.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, One second. (flees)
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby, Mm-hmm.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," And so, fortified with Maeby's information that Rebel was breaking up with her other beau..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Hello.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Michael.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...Michael decided to move things along.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," I think that I've been coming on a little bit too strong. I got a lot going on, I got the movie. You know, a bunch of stuff with the housing complex, and I'm just... I'm not gonna be pressuring you anymore. I want to just keep it easy-peasy. Yeah."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Cool. Totally.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Keep it loose.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Yeah.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," And we'll have some fun with, you know, the... If the fun, you know... Someday, one day, gets more serious, you know, then, then it does, and, and we, uh, we're, we're walking down the aisle, you know, and... I'm saying it wrong, saying it wrong, 'cause I get, uh, I get tongue-tied. Um, uh, because I think that you are... coming on too strong. You know. Bugging me."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, You want to come in?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, No?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Oh. (moves to kiss him)
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Yeah. Yeah.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, It was the best sex Michael ever had.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Was that fun for you?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, No. (gets out phone)
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Are you gonna take a photo of me?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Uh, no, no. I've been... trying to get a signal."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, But he did want a picture of them together. Which is why he grabbed the one he saw from the photo booth.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Are you gonna call me?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, If I'm in traffic. (they kiss)
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, Although he was growing concerned about how he was going to keep this up.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," (singing) Hey! I just stole this fair young miss from a big shot, George Mahar-"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, (BLEEP)
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," Michael had just found out that the woman he loved was also dating his son. So, after placing a call to the niece who sent him there..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Maeby, Hello?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, You're out of the movie.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," ...and at an emotional impasse, he decided it was time to deal with G.O.B. and the Sudden Valley problem."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," (seeing ""I brake for kids"" bumper sticker) Pervert. (getting out) Excuse me!"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, And that's when Michael ran into a son...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Dad! Hey.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," George Michael, what are you doing here?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...who was eager to make him proud.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, I'm home.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, But George Michael had suddenly found himself with enormous debt...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, You bought this house?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...and tried to hide his panic.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Why would you buy one of these pieces of sh... short-term... investments?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Well, you know, G.O.B. told me that you wanted to start selling these things, not just renting them, and... I knew it was important to you."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," He said all that, huh? Oh, boy, that was... That's... nice of him. How, how could you afford one of these houses, buddy?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Well, I have a lot of money coming in from investors for my software thing, and..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Okay.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," And I don't know what's going to happen with that, so I thought I'd do what everyone around here says, put it into Bluth."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Yeah, who else is saying that?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Oh, you know, it's an expression. Neighbors."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, I don't like it.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Can I offer you anything?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, No.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, I just got two more boxes of Twister from the neighbors.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Oh, boy. Return them."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Feel like I have one for every day of the week now. Anyway, you know, I figure that worst-case scenario is I sell this place and I get my money back. It's not like they're going down in value, right?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Well...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, It's a great community. Nobody locks their doors around here.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, You should.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Plus I, I wanted to make it up to you. You know, I felt terrible about what happened with the dorm, and..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Wow.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," ...and things between us, and... I've screwed up a lot of things in the past few weeks, and... you know, this is the one thing that... I know I did right. I mean, who would not want to raise their kids here?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, And perhaps this is why he didn't give him the bad news about the neighborhood.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Thank you. Thanks, but... you know, you didn't need to do it for me, pal."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, Now he just needed to get out of the house before...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Oh, you know, to be totally honest, I didn't just do it for you."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Yeah?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, I also did it for my girlfriend. Kind of wanted to impress her.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...that came up.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Wow. You got a girlfriend. Good for you. That's great. Congratulations. Your dad's got one too.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Oh, yeah?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Yep. How is yours going?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Not great. I haven't been completely honest with her about... who I am. You know, I, I haven't even told her my real name, and I don't think I can... keep that lie going, so... I think it might be over."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Oh, great. ...pain fades slowly. Quickly."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, But now it was as simple as getting out before George Michael asked about...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Thanks. But what about you? You're doing great, huh? Tell me about your girlfriend, and you're producing this movie now...?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...that.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, I think they're both over.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Oh.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Yeah, it wasn't meant to be."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, I'm sorry.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, And that's when Michael finally treated his son like an adult.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Hey, you know what I miss on you? The mustache."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," And so, discouraged, Michael returned to his apartment, only to find worse news."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," And when he saw that Lucille 2 was having a campaign event at Cinco, he knew there was only one thing he could give her instead of the money. And he knew what he had to do first to give it to her."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," George Michael, meanwhile, had a keynote speech to give, and hadn't fully decided whether he should come clean. And that's when he ran into his uncle."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B.," ...we'll take care of. My father's got the money. You guys are one heck of a, uh, horde."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Uncle G.O.B.!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B.," No, you're mistaken, friend."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," No, it's George Michael. Hi. Exactly."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B., Yes.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Hey, I'm actually really glad I ran into you. I could use some advice."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B., Oh. Love each other.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Oh, no, that's great, but I actually need a, a specific piece of advice for a certain situation, it's... I'll give it to you fast. Basically, for the past few weeks I've been living a lie. I've been in this relationship with a woman who doesn't even know. It's probably over with the girl. I might have a chance..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," ...gone way too far, it had gotten out of control. So basically now I can either tell her that there is no George Maharis and never was, or... we keep things anonymous, and I continue the lie that Fakeblock exists."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B.," From my perspective... something about ""there's a girl..."" Did you... Does she like you? I mean, you're not the world's most handsome guy."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Yeah, no, she likes..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B., I would say what I did take away was that I would rather have sex with someone because they thought I was someone else than not have sex with someone because they thought I was me.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," So I should probably do the opposite of that and... be true to who I am and not compromise... my integrity just for some fleeting sexual... experience. So, ""love each other."""
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B., There it is.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," It wasn't much help, and as George Michael headed off, unsure of what to do, G.O.B. went off to find his father, who was having his own relationship crisis."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Lucille, We're going to court. We're getting a real divorce. You're out of the marriage. 
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,"George, Sr.", So I am fat.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B.," Boy, am I glad you're here. I need money and it's not for what you think, for a magic show or a bee colony. It's to pay the builders I hired to start building the fake wall between Mexico and America."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,"George, Sr.", Shh! Are you crazy? Lucille 2 is around here.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B.," Well, don't worry about Lucille 2. I'll handle her. It's just that I need to pay the Chinese."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,"George, Sr."," Wait, wait, you... you hired Chinese?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B.," Well, I figured, who better than the Chinese to build a wall? But no, I couldn't afford them. So I, I hired, um... they're technically Mongols, I guess. They're, they're the people that they built the wall to try to keep out."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,"George, Sr."," How, how many did you hire?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B.," A horde. That's the minimum, they don't come in anything less than a horde."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,"George, Sr.", So you hired a Mongol horde.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B.," Look, Dad, I just... If they don't get their money soon, they're gonna be really mad, and then they're gonna have a major Mongolian beef with us. There they are."

4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B.," Well, he says that we don't have any money."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," And at that moment, another Bluth who had no money was finding a way to pay up."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Lucille 2," Michael, do you have something for me? (he goes to kiss her) What are you doing? "
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, I'm gonna have sex with you. For money. (she slaps him and he falls) Oh!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Lucille 2," Oh, I didn't realize how heavy these rings are."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Yeah.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Lucille 2, But I thought you were gonna kiss me and I panicked. (laughing)
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," I, I was gonna kiss you. (she slaps him again) Ow. I didn't even try to do it that time."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Lucille 2," So, it's, uh, ""Let's take a tumble with Old Moneybags,"" right? And she'll be so grateful that she'd walk away from $700,000."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," No, no, no, it would absolutely not be a gift. This would still be a loan, okay? However, my lovemaking would be, you know..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Lucille 2," What? What, Michael? What were you gonna say?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Something that I would never be able to take back, but... (she slaps him) ...I didn't want that to happen. Now, listen, you have been the one that has been flirting with me."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Lucille 2, Those were pity flirts.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," No, they were not. You want this as much as I do. As much as I want this extension. Two different this-es. Now, you own a company that I helped to build. It was all of my hard work. This is something you have to do, because if you don't, I can't be held responsible for what I might do."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," As it turns out, George Michael was the only Bluth who could be responsible for what he did, and as he headed to the microphone, Mongols, not paid what they were promised, did what they do best."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Lindsay, Oh! Aah!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Marauder, Viva Mongolia!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, Which led to this.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Lindsay," What, what's happening?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Lindsay/Crowd, Put! Up! This! Wall! Put! Up! This! Wall! Put-
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," And it's hard to know whether it was the chanting of ""put up this wall""..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention for a moment for an announcement..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...or the note that promised him a sexual resumption of his anonymous relationship with Rebel...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...that made him say this.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Yeah, so, I'm George Maharis. And, uh, and Fakeblock is... real. Let's put up this wall."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Crowd, Put! Up! This! Wall! Put! Up! This! Wall!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, But not everyone wants to put up a wall on the Internet.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Let's put up... put up this wall. Have a good night.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, And the Anonymous who left the note wasn't Rebel.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," A discouraged Michael returned to the model home, where he ran into a brother who also had something to hide..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Tony Wonder, (BLEEP)!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," ...as an emboldened George Maharis gave Rebel a note that she now believed he'd written for her. And for the son, it was a night to remember..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," ...and for the father, a night to forget."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,G.O.B., So easy to forget. Shh.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Rebel. Michael. I...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," It was May 5th, and while Rebel was on the phone..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," Well, there's somebody here right now."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, (over phone) I don't care. The thing with the other guy... 
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...George Michael was realizing that taking things casually was not going to be an option for him.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley," You can come over later, okay? "
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Goodbye. 
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, I'll see you soon. 
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Who was that? 
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, No one. 
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Look, I don't care. I, I don't care that you're seeing someone else. I, I just... I want to continue this. I'm ready to try and make this work. I'll fight anyone I have to for you. I'm not going to pretend I don't care about you. I'm a grown-up man and... I want to get serious."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Wow. Serious. Things are getting serious.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, And the girl who was never capable of making a commitment...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Okay.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, ...suddenly found herself making too many.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Rebel Alley, Okay.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Okay.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," George Michael felt good. And at least for that day, he wouldn't encounter his father in Rebel's bedroom. He'd run into him leaving the building."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Hey! What are you doing here?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," I, I'm on a visit. I'm visiting."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, My girlfriend lives here. Rebel.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Wow, so you're gonna work it out with your girlfriend. Good for you, that's great news."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," (pointing at cactus) That, that says Rebel, huh? What?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Great to see you again.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Is that, is that a... Is that a little gift for Rebel?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," I'm dating Rebel Alley. So there'd better be two Rebels in here, am I right?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, I'm dating Rebel Alley.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," (laughs) That'd be weird. No, ironically, she did say that there was another guy, but that his name was George..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Both, Maharis.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, That's me.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, You're George Michael.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," No, but, uh, yeah, but I use the name George Maharis when... with women, because... I hate the name George Michael! I told you that."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," This is, uh... this is weird. Are you not kidding me?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, It's insane. No.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Oh, so..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, So you're the other guy.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," I'm the other... well, you're the other guy."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Yeah. Well, one of us"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, Did I not tell you that we were alike? Exactly alike. This is just...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, Horrifying.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," ...too funny. This is what I was talking about. I told you. I mean, we're like twins. Are we not like twins? All the way down to the photo booth. You name me one way in which we're different."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Well, Dad, you know I never, in a million years, would have gone out with her if I knew that you were, you know, the other guy."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," Me, neither."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael, I...
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," I wouldn't have either. Damn it. You know? You gotta believe me. This is just... (they hug) This is, uh..."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,George Michael," Yeah. ...How, how'd you know about the photo booth? (silence) You, 'cause you said, ""Right down to the photo..."""
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael," I said, ""Right down to the photo booth."""
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator," Ironically, he could've told the truth and said he'd taken a Forget-Me-Now. But like the victim of a roofie circle, having taken one was the only memory he had lost. So instead, he doubled down on this."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Michael, It's like we're identical twi-

4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Tony Wonder," (phone message) Hey, Gobie. It's Tony. We still on for our sex date tonight?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Narrator, And this happens.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Buster," Oh! Okay, okay."

4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Officer Taylor, You're under arrest for the murder of Lucille Austero. Read him his rights.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Buster," Okay, I think there's been some kind of mistake. That left hand might be difficult to cuff."
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Officer Taylor, Trouble cuffing him.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Buster, I'm not a monster!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Cop, I got it.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Officer Taylor," Y- all right, great. (twirls baton)"

4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Brian Grazer," Yeah, I saw it just now in the elevator. Is this the family you've been talking about?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Ron Howard, It sure is.
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Brian Grazer, Wow. You got the rights to this?
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Ron Howard," Well, only for the killer. But that's enough for us to get a green light, right?"
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Brian Grazer, Absolutely! It's our next Da Vinci Code!
4,Blockheads,https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript_of_Blockheads,Ron Howard, Yay! (they hug) That's great. Plus it's gonna put Imagine News on the map.
